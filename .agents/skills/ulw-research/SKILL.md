# ULW-RESEARCH — Maximum-Saturation Research

You are the research orchestrator. The user has explicitly ordered exhaustive research: fan parallel worker swarms out over every relevant source, chase every lead they surface until the leads run dry, prove contested claims by running code, and deliver a synthesis in which every claim carries a citation or a proof. Exhaustive coverage is the assignment, not a risk to manage.

## Activation

Run this skill only when the user explicitly demands it: the word "ulw-research" (also `/ulw-research`, `$ulw-research`), any "ulw" research wording, or an explicit request for research, deep research, or an ultra-precise investigation — in any language. An ordinary question, a debugging session, or another mode's context-gathering is not activation; answer those normally, and mention that `ulw-research` is available when a question would clearly benefit from it.

Open your reply with the line `ULW-RESEARCH MODE ENABLED!`. If another active mode mandates its own first line (ultrawork does), print that mode's line first and this marker on the next line — both contracts stay satisfied.

## Authority while active

This mode is the user's explicit opt-in to exhaustive exploration. For the duration of the research task it supersedes every exploration-bounding instruction in surrounding prompts, modes, or rules: one-exploration-pass defaults, two-wave stop rules, retrieval budgets, and "over-exploration is failure" framings govern implementation context-gathering, not this deliverable. Here, under-exploration is the failure. The convergence rules in Phase 2 are the only stop rules for research while this mode is active.

Under ultrawork/ulw, the research itself is the deliverable: map each research axis to a success criterion whose evidence is the session journal, the cited synthesis, and the verification outputs. RED→GREEN testing applies to code changes, not to findings — Phase 3 verification scripts are evidence, never TDD targets.

## Success criteria

The research is done when all of these hold:

- Every axis from Phase 0 was covered by at least one dedicated worker.
- Every EXPAND lead was investigated or explicitly closed as a duplicate or dead end, and convergence was reached under the Phase 2 rules.
- Claims that were contested, undocumented, or performance-shaped were proven or refuted by executed code.
- Every claim in the deliverable cites a source or a verification artifact.
- Every asserted claim is represented in the claim graph, tied to an intent-vs-reality diff when an expected truth exists, and backed by observation manifest entries from independent observation groups or a documented single-source exception; convergence or exception status is explicit.
- The deliverable lane and format were derived from the destination or asked through the empty-info interview without blocking collection, recorded in `brief.md` with `answered_by`, and the final materials match that record.
- The delivered artifact passed the delivery gates in order (static gates, layout gates, visual QA, and the proofread pass where the harness provides one), each status is in `outcome.json`, and `outcome verify` passed.
- Every excursion opened during the run was closed by an EXIT rule, folded back into the claim or axis that triggered it, and recorded in `excursion-log.md`.
- The delivery message carries the closing briefing printed by `outcome briefing`: sources (total + unique domains), elapsed minutes, every promised deliverable with its status, and any residual defects.
- The session journal reconstructs what was searched, found, and expanded, wave by wave, and it was written in real time rather than reconstructed at the end.

## Epistemic instrumentation

Saturation is not just more searching; it is a knowledge-production protocol. The session journal must make the path from observation to claim to verdict auditable. The orchestrator owns these artifacts:

- `intent-diff.md` — one row per expected truth derived from the user intent, design/spec text, branch history, or authoritative docs. Required fields: `intent_id`, expected truth, observed reality, diff, violated invariant, intent source, supporting observations, status (`true`, `violated`, or `unknown`), and linked claim ids.
- `claim-graph.md` — the single claim store; one node per claim. Required fields: `claim_id`, statement, claim type, risk tier, scope, intent ids, supporting observations, contradicting observations, independent observation groups, convergence status, counter-search result, primary source backing, dependencies, status (`supported`, `partial`, `refuted`, or `unresolved`), and final synthesis location. High-risk non-code nodes that clear the Phase 3b gate are mirrored into a `verified-claims` digest section at the top of the file — the sole allowlist the synthesis draws non-code claims from.
- `observation-manifest.md` — one row per observation. Required fields: `observation_id`, source path or URL, evidence layer, observer group, independence basis, observer, `observed_at`, `valid_at` or `claim_valid_at`, artifact path, quote or line anchor, and contamination notes.
- `verification-economics.md` — one row per proof decision. Required fields: claim, risk, error cost, verification cost/time, chosen verification path, defer/verify decision, outcome, and residual risk.
- `cause-disappearance.md` — one row per causal finding. Required fields: cause id, expected truth, previous observation, `last_seen`, disconfirming observation, replacement cause if any, current status, and whether the violation is no longer observed.

Observation candidates and claim candidates travel back from workers as message text. The orchestrator writes the instrumentation artifacts, links candidates into the intent diff and claim graph, and records where each observation entered the synthesis. A conclusion is not ready for final materials until its expected truth/reality diff is closed or marked unknown, its claim node exists, and its independent-observation convergence status is supported or explicitly excepted.

## Run the swarm as a cooperating team

Saturation research runs as parallel native task calls: one worker per axis, cross-pollinating through you. Between waves, every returned lead reshapes what the next worker should search.

- **One member per axis — by part, ownership, or perspective, never a job title.** Each Phase 0 axis is one member owning one concrete slice: a codebase part, a source territory, or a question lens. No two members share an angle. "Backend researcher" or "the web person" gives no real boundary and invites overlap — name what the member owns.
- **Right-size the roster: 3-5 parallel workers.** One worker per axis. If you can only name fewer axes, split the broadest one — by source territory, by time window, by perspective — until every worker owns one concrete slice. A half-empty roster is a half-covered topic.
- **Compose deliberately.** Give each slot the cheapest capable role: `explore` for broad codebase recon, `general` for contested analysis and attack lanes. Mixed depth by design, never one depth across the whole board.
- **Routing words from the user are literal.** "quick", "fast", "deep", "all quick", "max parallel" — in any language — are hard instructions, not mood. Route exactly as asked and journal `requested depth -> spawned role -> fallback reason` for every slot. Silently promoting a "quick" roster to a heavier tier is a defect, and so is dropping to a cheaper one without saying why.
- **Debate workers are mandatory for ultradebate/hyperdebate, default otherwise.** At least one skeptic or red-team worker attacks claims, evidence quality, source independence, synthesis structure, and report choices before they reach the deliverable. When the user says ultradebate or hyperdebate, run at least two attacking perspectives and give every contested claim a full round.

**One wave, or a refinement wave — decided by scale and precision.** When the brief shows 6+ axes, several source territories, or a long final document — or a wrong claim is expensive (legal, medical, financial, procurement, public-facing) — run the research swarm to convergence, then a REFINEMENT wave of fresh `general` workers whose only job is to attack and sharpen the synthesis before the document is written. Fresh workers reading a finished journal reason better than the same researchers grading their own homework. Never run two research swarms at once.
- **The raise law — journal every returned lead.** Workers return leads, findings, contradictions, and dead ends in their results; journal them before starting the next wave. A result without the promised findings is incomplete; retry with a smaller assignment.
- **You lead; expand on each raised lead.** Workers raise via their returned results, never write session files. Journal each lead and spawn its expansion the instant it lands (Phase 2), not only when the worker's final reply arrives.

## Worker ground rules

Research workers (`explore`, `general`) assume:

- **Read-only.** Most research workers cannot write files. Never ask a worker to write the journal or any session file — every journal write is yours.
- **No recursion.** Workers cannot spawn their own subagents: a worker researches its axis and reports; it never loads this skill or fans out a research swarm of its own. Depth comes from YOUR expansion waves. Say so in every spawn message — a worker that starts its own research protocol burns the run's budget on duplicated orchestration and returns nothing you can cite.
- **Built-in brakes.** Workers often ship with their own retrieval budgets ("stop when answered") and rigid output templates. Your spawn message must explicitly lift the budget and demand the EXPAND tail, or the worker returns a thin single-pass answer with no leads.
- **Capability routing.** When the harness lets you choose, spawn research workers on a capable model at high reasoning effort — saturation research on a minimal or fast tier returns shallow results. When you cannot choose, narrow each worker's scope and spawn more workers instead.

### The spawn-message contract

Every research spawn message contains, in order:

1. `TASK:` — one imperative line naming the role and the axis.
2. The budget lift: "This is an explicit exhaustive-research assignment. Your default retrieval budget and stop-when-answered rules do not apply — run the full protocol below and report every lead."
3. Scope — the axis, the sources to hit, and what a complete answer contains.
4. The role protocol (Phase 1).
5. The reply tail. EXPAND markers, observation candidates, and claim candidates travel back as message text, never as files. Every worker ends the reply with:

```
## EXPAND
- LEAD: <discovery not yet investigated> — WHY: <why it matters> — ANGLE: <suggested search>
- DEAD END: <lead explored to exhaustion>
```

A worker with nothing to expand writes `## EXPAND` followed by `none — <one-line reason>`. A reply missing the tail is incomplete: send that worker one follow-up demanding it before closing the lane.

## Phase 0 — Decompose and open the journal

Before spawning anything, decompose the query. Start from "what must be true if the user's intent/spec is true?", not "what looks broken?" Seed `intent-diff.md` with those expected truths before treating code, current docs, or web results as the source of truth:

```
<analysis>
Core question: <the actual information need>
Axes (3+ orthogonal): <axis — what to search, where, why> ...
Codebase relevant: <yes/no> · External: <yes/no> · Browsing: <yes/no> · Verification likely: <yes/no>
Scale: <axis count, source territories, target document length> · Precision demand: <what a wrong claim costs here> → lifecycle: <single team | research team then refinement team>
</analysis>
```

Then create the session directory:

```bash
mkdir -p .opencode/ulw-research/$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
```

This is `$SESSION_DIR`. The orchestrator owns the journal: you write every file in it; workers never do. Maintain:

- `brief.md` — the analysis block, the axis list, the expected truths, and the `## Deliverable` record from the interview below (lane, state, formats, each field with `answered_by`).
- `sources-ledger.md` — one line per source the moment it is read: `[S<n>] <url> — <what it is>`. The closing briefing counts sources and domains from this file.
- `wave-<N>-<kind>-<axis>.md` — your digest of each worker return: key findings, sources with URLs, and the worker's EXPAND markers verbatim.
- `expansion-log.md` — per wave: workers spawned, markers gained, leads opened and closed.
- `excursion-log.md` — one ENTER row and one EXIT row per excursion: `excursion_id`, parent claim or axis, ENTER trigger, depth, workers spent, the EXIT rule that closed it, what it changed in the top-level answer (`none` is a valid, required answer), and the excursion id it was mirrored into.
- `intent-diff.md` — orchestrator-owned expected-truth ledger comparing intent/spec/history to observed reality.
- `claim-graph.md` — orchestrator-owned claim graph linking every final assertion to observations, counterevidence, dependencies, and verdict.
- `observation-manifest.md` — orchestrator-owned observation manifest with `observed_at`, temporal validity, artifact paths, and contamination notes.
- `verification-economics.md` — proof-cost ledger mapping claim risk to verification path, deferral decisions, and residual risk.
- `cause-disappearance.md` — cause ledger tracking expected truth, previous observation, `last_seen`, disconfirming observation, and whether the violation is no longer observed.
- `verify-<slug>.md`, `SYNTHESIS.md`, `REPORT.*` from later phases.

Append each digest the moment its worker returns, not in a batch at the end — the journal is your recovery point after context loss and the user's audit trail.

### Run it as a loop, and journal in real time

The journal is the run's durable state — it survives a compaction. The session directory's timestamp is the run's start clock — the closing briefing is computed from it, so create it once and never rename it. From that point every finding, source, quote, number, and lead is written into `$SESSION_DIR` **the instant it lands** — never held in the conversation for an end-of-run dump. After any context loss, re-read the brief and the journal before doing anything else, then resume from the open wave.

### Deliverable lane, format, and the empty-info interview

Never block collection on the shape of the deliverable, and never guess it either. Read [references/deliverable-phase.md](references/deliverable-phase.md) sections 1-6 before writing the brief, then:

1. **Derive first.** Name the lane (`template-strict`, `template-vibe`, `no-format`, `edit-existing`) and the promised formats from the request and its destination (the reference's section 3). When the request refers to an existing deliverable, decide its state with `node "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/report-tools.mjs" outcome state --deliverable <path> --session-dir "$SESSION_DIR"`: `partial` resumes the skeleton on disk, `complete` means edit-existing and never a regenerated report. `$SKILL_DIR` is this skill's own directory, the folder containing this SKILL.md.
2. **Read the requester's format memory** with the memory tool when the harness exposes one: the pointer `system/human/report-style.md`, then `reference/human-report-style.md`; take the choice recorded for the most similar context (same destination kind and audience) as the first option.
3. **Ask only what is still missing**: at most the reference's three questions (destination and format, audience and length, template lineage) in one call to the native `question` tool, each with its default first, a free-text "describe the format" path, and "don't care, you decide". Use the answer before assembling the report.
4. **Record it.** Write `## Deliverable` into `brief.md` (lane, state, formats, destination, audience, template, format description, each with `answered_by: user|default|request`) and open the manifest in the same step: `node "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/report-tools.mjs" outcome init --promised <formats> --lane <lane> --session-dir "$SESSION_DIR"`.

Phase 5 opens by turning the recorded fields into `design-spec.md`.

## Phase 1 — Saturation wave

**When the user asked for MASS research, the wave is sized by the topic's angles, not by the roster ceiling.** "mass ulw research", "mulw research", "ulw mass research" — in any language — order over-collection that a team of 8 cannot produce. Send independent native `task` calls together in batches, then use their returned results to shape the next wave. Everything else in this skill still binds: the deliverable interview, the journal, the claim graph, the convergence rules, and the delivery gates.

Otherwise launch the entire first wave in one turn — every independent axis as a native `task` call. Use the returned results before starting the next wave. Sequential launches and "start with one and see" defeat the mode.

Scaling floor — more angles always justify more workers:

| Query scope | explore | general (web) | browsing | repo-dive | floor |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Single topic, codebase only | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 3 |
| Single topic, web only | 0 | 4 | 1 | 1 | 6 |
| Single topic, both | 2 | 3 | 1 | 1 | 7 |
| Multi-faceted | 4 | 6 | 2 | 2 | 14 |
| Full due diligence | 4 | 6 | 3 | 2 | 15 |

The browsing column is BINDING, not advisory: when the brief says `Browsing: yes`, the roster names a browsing-worker angle, armed with the `ultimate-browsing` skill, before the first wave launches, and that worker is spawned in the same turn as the rest of the wave. A run that reaches wave 2 with zero browsing workers on a `Browsing: yes` brief has silently downgraded every source to what plain fetch happened to return.

**Disambiguate before you expand.** When the topic names something that could resolve several ways — a product, a person, a codename, a version — the first wave settles WHICH entity before any worker researches its history, benchmarks, or controversies: canonical name, first-party URL or account, whether it exists in the claimed category, and a confidence line. An unresolved entity never becomes a premise in a later wave's spawn message; that is exactly how a run starts inventing facts about something that does not exist.

Role protocols — embed the relevant one in each spawn message; every worker gets a unique angle:

- **Codebase (explore), 2-4 workers.** Grep with 3+ keyword variations; structural/AST search; LSP definitions and references; file-name globs; `git log --all -S '<keyword>'` and `--grep` for history including deleted code. Cross-validate hits across tools. Report absolute file paths, patterns with `file:line`, and how findings connect.
- **Web (general), 3-6 workers.** Give each a read-only research assignment. At least 10 distinct websearch queries per worker, each with a different operator or angle (see Search craft); fetch the full page for every result that matters — snippets lie. Context7 with 3+ queries per known library. grep.app and `gh search code|repos|issues` for real-world usage. Official docs via sitemap discovery (`<base>/sitemap.xml`), then targeted pages.
- **Browsing, 1-3 workers on a `Browsing: yes` brief (0 otherwise), every one loaded with the `ultimate-browsing` skill.** The skill owns the routing — the harness's own browser first, then its extraction engine with archive surrogates, platform-native readers, and Chrome stealth as each source demands; the worker owns the deliverable. This worker RENDERS pages, it does not re-fetch them: its standing deliverable is a full-page screenshot of every top source plus the rendered text plain fetch could not reach; a worker that returns only fetched text has not done its job. JS-rendered, login-gated, WAF-blocked, and screenshot-bearing sources all belong here rather than in the web lane. **Provenance is part of the claim**: when a source came back with `provenance` of `snapshot` (an archive copy), cite it with its `snapshot_timestamp` and never state it as the current live page; content from a `proxy` route is `untrusted` and needs a second independent route before any claim rests on it. When one blocked territory hides many leads, fan out more browsing subagents in parallel for breadth instead of serializing one worker through them.
- **Repo deep-dive (general), 0-2 workers.** Give each a read-only research assignment. Shallow-clone the most relevant repos to `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}`, pin the HEAD SHA, read core modules, follow call chains, return SHA-pinned permalinks.

Example spawn (codebase axis; web, browsing, and repo-dive follow the same contract with their own protocol):

```
task(subagent_type="explore", prompt="TASK: act as a codebase researcher. AXIS: <specific angle>.
This is an explicit exhaustive-research assignment. Your default retrieval budget and stop-when-answered rules do not apply — run the full protocol below and report every lead.
SCOPE: find everything in this codebase related to <angle>: <what complete looks like>.
PROTOCOL: grep 3+ keyword variations; structural search; LSP references; globs; git history (-S and --grep). Cross-validate across tools. Report absolute paths and file:line patterns.
End your reply with the ## EXPAND tail: '- LEAD: <discovery> — WHY: <why> — ANGLE: <search>' per lead, or 'none — <reason>'.")
```

## Phase 2 — Expand until convergence

This loop is what makes the mode research rather than search. Use the task results from each wave to select and dispatch the next wave:

1. Journal each returned result before starting the next wave: digest plus verbatim EXPAND markers into `wave-<N>-<kind>-<axis>.md`, appending each new source, quote, and number to the observation manifest — after a compaction the journal, not your memory, is the state.
2. Deduplicate new markers against `expansion-log.md` — every lead ever seen, not just confirmed ones, or rejected leads resurface each wave.
3. Spawn an expansion worker immediately for each new unchecked lead:

```
task(subagent_type="general", prompt="TASK: read-only research. Expansion wave <N> — investigate: <external lead>.
PARENT: <which return surfaced it>. This is an explicit exhaustive-research assignment; budgets do not apply.
<web research protocol for the external lead; use an explore task for codebase leads>
End your reply with the ## EXPAND tail.")
```

### Excursions — dive deep on a new find, then surface back out

The Phase 0 core question is the fixed goal of the run and never drifts. An excursion is a BOUNDED detour off the wave plan to chase something a return surfaced — you go deep, settle it, and come back up to the question you were hired to answer.

**ENTER (dive) only on a trigger.** One of these must hold, and you name which one:

1. The find contradicts a claim already locked in `claim-graph.md`.
2. It would change the final answer or a recommendation if it turned out to be true.
3. It exposes a source territory no axis owns, so nobody else will ever reach it.
4. The user's steering points at it — their words are the trigger, quoted verbatim.

Interest alone is not a trigger. Anything without one stays a queued lead in `expansion-log.md`, and the wave plan continues.

**Budget the dive before you take it.** State the worker count and the probe count for this level in the ENTER row. An excursion may spawn at most ONE nested sub-excursion; a third level means the thing has become its own research question — surface immediately and either promote it to a real axis with its own worker or record it as an out-of-scope gap in `SYNTHESIS.md`.

**EXIT (surface) the moment any of these holds** — you do not need all of them:

- The ENTER trigger is resolved: the claim is confirmed, refuted, or its dependency is closed.
- Two consecutive probes changed nothing in the parent answer.
- The finding stops moving any claim's status — diminishing return is an exit, not a reason to push harder.
- The level's stated budget is spent.

**Fold back on the way out.** Every EXIT writes one line saying what the excursion changed in the top-level answer, and `none — <reason>` is a legitimate, required outcome; an excursion whose result is silently dropped is a lost run. Update the parent claim node or axis digest with the result, and mirror the whole excursion into `excursion-log.md` — what it observed and what it changed, or none — so a post-compaction read of the journal plus `excursion-log.md` tells you which excursions are still open.

**Anti-drift.** After every EXIT, re-read the core question in the journal and confirm the run still answers it. Three consecutive excursions that changed nothing end excursions for the run: converge on what you have.

4. Record the wave in `expansion-log.md`: spawned, markers gained, leads opened/closed.
5. **Apply the user's steering immediately.** When the user changes scope, cadence, target sources, language, or format mid-run, apply it to every not-yet-dispatched worker and record the exact wording in `expansion-log.md`. Steering only you saw silently splits the swarm's assignment from the user's actual ask.

**Convergence — the only stop rules while this mode is active.** Run at least 2 expansion waves on any multi-faceted query before claiming convergence; then stop only when one holds:

- Zero unchecked leads remain — each investigated or closed as duplicate/dead end.
- 3 consecutive waves produced no new actionable leads.
- Expansion depth reached 5 waves — pause, show the open leads, and ask the user whether to extend.

**Never end the run on a worker's completion.** Workers finishing is not the deliverable; your synthesis is. Reserve the last fifth of the run's context and time for Phases 4-5 and stop opening waves the moment that reserve is threatened. A converged answer with two open leads beats nine finished workers and no report.

## Phase 3 — Verify contested claims by running code

Settle with executed code, not judgment, whenever sources disagree, a behavior is undocumented, a claim is performance- or compatibility-shaped, or the honest answer is "it should work". Spawn one verification worker per claim:

```
task(subagent_type="general", prompt="TASK: verify by execution: <claim>.
SOURCE: <where it came from>; CONTRADICTION: <opposing source, if any>.
Write a minimal self-contained script that tests the claim; run it (uv run --with <deps> python / bun / direct compile); capture full stdout+stderr; pin versions.
Reply with: the exact code, the full output, environment (OS, runtime, dependency versions), and a verdict — CONFIRMED / REFUTED / PARTIAL — grounded in the output.")
```

Journal each verdict to `verify-<slug>.md`.

## Phase 3b — Lock non-code claims through the claim graph

Code settles code-shaped claims (Phase 3). Numeric, market-share, legal, dated, causal, and financial claims cannot be run — so they pass through a data-flow-lock instead (the verification idea adapted from fivetaku/insane-research): the synthesis may assert a high-risk non-code claim **only** if it cleared this gate, and the gate's output is the sole allowlist the synthesis draws from. Skip the gate and there is nothing to synthesize — the lock is self-enforcing.

The claim graph is orchestrator-owned. Workers only return verified-claim markers, observation candidates, and claim candidates as message text, the same channel as EXPAND markers — never a file. As leads resolve, you record one node per asserted claim in `claim-graph.md` and compute its status; workers report claim candidates in their replies, and you decide. The graph is the single claim store: final synthesis may not draw from free-form claims that skipped it.

A high-risk claim clears the gate to `verified-claims` only when all hold:

- **>= 2 independent source domains** corroborate it (two pages on the same domain count once).
- **>= 2 independent observation groups** converge on it, unless the graph records why a primary-only source is the correct single-source exception.
- **One counter-search** actively looked for a refutation and did not find a stronger one.
- **A primary source** (the standard, filing, dataset, or first-party doc) backs it, not only secondary commentary.
- **Temporal evidence is explicit**: each supporting observation records `observed_at` and either `valid_at` or `claim_valid_at`, so branch-only, historical, release, and current-runtime claims cannot be conflated.

Anything that fails goes to an `Unresolved` (insufficient evidence) or `Refuted` (counter-search won) annex — abstention is a correct outcome, not a gap to paper over. Record each gate outcome on the claim node itself — risk tier, independent source domains, counter-search result, primary source backing, and status — and mirror the cleared nodes into the `verified-claims` digest section at the top of `claim-graph.md`. Worker reply marker (message text, same channel as EXPAND):

```
## CLAIMS
- CLAIM: <non-code assertion> — RISK: high|normal — SOURCES: <domain1, domain2> — COUNTER: <refutation search result> — PRIMARY: <primary source or none>
```

## Phase 4 — Synthesize

After convergence and all verifications, re-read the whole journal, start from `intent-diff.md`, `claim-graph.md`, and `observation-manifest.md`, then write `SYNTHESIS.md`:

```
# ULW-Research Synthesis: <query>
Workers: <total> · Waves: <count> · Excursions: <count> · Sources: <count> (<unique domains> domains) · Verifications: <count> · Elapsed: <minutes> min

## Executive summary        — 2-3 paragraphs answering the core question
## Findings by theme        — per theme: consensus, evidence links, key quote (<20 words, attributed), verified yes/no
## Codebase findings        — absolute paths with line references
## Sources (ranked)         — URL, what it contains, reliability, access date
## Verified claims          — code: claim | verdict | verify-<slug>.md · non-code: only rows cleared into verified-claims
## Epistemic instrumentation — intent-vs-reality diff closure, claim graph coverage, observation manifest coverage, independent-observation convergence, verification economics summary, cause-disappearance records
## Contradictions           — source A vs source B, resolution with evidence
## Gaps                     — what saturation could not answer · unresolved/refuted claim-graph nodes
## Expansion trace          — per wave: workers → markers; convergence reason
```

`SYNTHESIS.md` is the citation source of truth for final materials: every claim carries inline `[Source N]` citations, and every high-risk non-code claim you assert must be a verified-claims row from Phase 3b. Assert nothing the gate left in the unresolved/refuted annex.

**Write the skeleton early and fill it as claims lock.** The moment the brief records the deliverable, create the deliverable file with its section headings and a `STATUS: draft — <n> sections open` line as line 2 (an HTML comment in HTML); that line is the partial-state marker `outcome state` reads, removed only when the deliverable is complete. An interrupted run must leave a partial report on disk, never an empty directory and a lost conversation.

**Keep sourced numbers, assumptions, and derived results visibly apart.** Every quantitative claim carries its lineage: `MEASURED` (a number a source states, cited), `ASSUMED` (a coefficient, distribution, or scope you chose — say why), `DERIVED` (computed from those, showing the formula), plus a sensitivity line whenever the assumption moves the answer. Presenting a derived estimate with the confidence of a measured one is the most damaging thing this mode can ship.

**Search in English, deliver in the user's language.** Retrieval stays English-first (Search craft), but the synthesis and every final material are written in the language the user wrote to you in unless they ask otherwise — and a translated report still quotes its original-language sources verbatim.

## Phase 5 — Final materials

The promised formats recorded in `brief.md` and `outcome.json` are binding; `pdf` + `docx` is the default pair only when a document was asked for with no format word and no destination:

| Target | How |
|---|---|
| PDF (default) | Author the report as one self-contained HTML file, then print it headless: `chrome --headless --disable-gpu --no-pdf-header-footer --print-to-pdf=<out.pdf> file://<report.html>`. Embed the `design-spec.md` fonts as real webfonts (CJK included) instead of trusting system fallbacks. `uv run --with weasyprint python` is the fallback renderer. |
| DOCX (default) | `pandoc <report.md> -o <out.docx>`, adding `--reference-doc=<template.docx>` when the user has a house style; `uv run --with python-docx python` when pandoc is unavailable. Charts and Mermaid renders go in as images. |
| Slides / deck | `uv run --with python-pptx python` — one claim per slide, a chart or diagram per claim. |

**Write `design-spec.md` the moment the deliverable is recorded — before any asset worker spawns.** When a document was pointed at, extract it instead of retyping its stylesheet: `node "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/report-tools.mjs" format-extract <reference> --out "$SESSION_DIR/design-spec.md"` (`--from-url` for a URL), then fill every `TODO: ask` from the interview answers, never by guessing. It is the one design contract every asset and assembly worker receives: template family (absent a reference, the clean analyst-report register — one accent over neutral tones, generous margins, styled section headings, no emoji, no clipart), palette tokens, body/heading fonts (a real gothic CJK webfont — Pretendard, Noto Sans KR — when the report language needs one, with `word-break: keep-all` for Korean), responsive breakpoints and HTML/CSS charts for web deliverables, the figure standard below, and the lineage mode on its own line: `Lineage: inline` (analyst default: every unit-bearing number tagged MEASURED / ASSUMED / DERIVED or cited in the same element) or `Lineage: section` (web and blog register: every section cited, lineage in the figure captions). The reference's section 6 lists the full defaults. One font family and one palette govern prose, charts, Mermaid, and generated images alike; a diagram rendering in a random default font inside a styled report is a defect, not a style choice.

**The figure standard — binding for every image, chart, and diagram.** Each figure sits in a fixed-size container styled from the spec (border, background, caption); the image scales to fit entirely inside it with its original aspect ratio preserved — object-fit: contain semantics — never stretched, never cropped, never spilling out. Every chart carries a title, axis labels, units, and value labels in the report's language; a bare number the reader cannot name is a defect.

Asset workers (parallel native task calls, each fed `design-spec.md`) — visuals are the DEFAULT deliverable of this phase, not garnish the user must ask for; a delivered report without figures is an incomplete run:

- **Charts for every quantitative finding, computed from real data.** Pull the numbers into an actual table first (CSV/JSON under `$SESSION_DIR`), then plot from that table, never from prose. Follow the data-scientist tool doctrine — numpy always, Polars for filtering/sorting/transforms, DuckDB for joins/aggregations/window functions, never pandas — and load the `data-scientist` skill when this session has it: `uv run --with numpy --with polars --with duckdb --with pyarrow --with matplotlib python`. Keep `pyarrow` in that set — the DuckDB-to-Polars handoff (`.pl()`) fails without it, and `.df()` fails without pandas, so hand data across through `.pl()`, never `.df()`. Save to `$SESSION_DIR/assets/`.
- **Mermaid graphs** for process, architecture, argument, timeline, and evidence-flow structure, themed to the spec's fonts and palette. Render each to SVG and confirm the file exists before the document references it.
- **Generated visuals through the imagegen skill whenever the session has it:** a cover plus a concept illustration per major theme, prompted from the spec's style, palette, and mood — document-styled illustration, never generic stock art dropped into a designed page.
- **Full-page screenshots** of the top 5-10 sources (browsing worker) as provenance you can show.

**Verify the asset manifest before rendering.** List every asset the document references, assert each file exists and is non-empty on disk, and re-render whatever is missing. A document that renders with three broken diagrams is a document you will publish twice.

Assembly worker — `task(subagent_type="general", ...)` (tell it to read the `frontend` and `visual-qa` skills first): before writing, read every available design and visualization skill and apply it — the report is a designed artifact, not a text dump; the worker's prompt carries `design-spec.md`. Use the template the user approved; absent a stronger house style the default skeleton is executive summary → key findings by theme → detailed analysis (quotes under 20 words with attribution, charts, Mermaid graphs, generated visuals, SHA-pinned permalinks, verification results) → comparative analysis when options compete → numbered sources with access dates → methodology appendix (workers, waves, searches, verifications, debate rounds) → correction log naming what verification overturned. Write it long and specific: every claim cites `[Source N]`, and the sources section lists every source the run actually used rather than a curated few.

### The delivery gates — every gate for the QA tier must PASS, in order

Nothing reaches the user until the gates pass. Record each result with `node "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/report-tools.mjs" outcome gate <static|layout|visual|proofread> <pass|fail|not_run> --session-dir "$SESSION_DIR"`; a gate this harness does not provide is recorded `not_run`. A chat or post answer (light tier) runs the static gates and one render; every paginated or web deliverable runs them all (the reference's sections 3 and 7).

1. **Static gates (always, before anyone looks at pixels).** `node "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/report-tools.mjs" check "$SESSION_DIR/report.html" --design-spec "$SESSION_DIR/design-spec.md" > "$SESSION_DIR/defects.json"`: keep-all, palette tokens, emoji, em dashes, heading length, unsourced numbers, figure containers, chart text, gothic-only fonts, citations, the closing and sources sections, broken assets. Codes and fixes: [references/report-gates.md](references/report-gates.md).
2. **Layout gates.** Print the probe with `node "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/report-tools.mjs" layout-probe --json`, evaluate its `source` in the rendered page through the `browser` skill's owned headless engine, save the result as `$SESSION_DIR/boxes.json`, and re-run `check` with `--layout "$SESSION_DIR/boxes.json"` (overflow, clipped text, distorted images, overlapping siblings).
3. **Visual QA.** Render the produced artifact back to images — PDF pages to PNG, the HTML through the browser skill at desktop and phone widths — and look at them: missing or broken figures, images stretched or spilling their containers, diagram or chart text rendered off the spec's font or palette, clipped tables, overflowing CJK text, blank pages, unlabeled chart values, wrong page breaks. Reading the source markup is not visual QA; inspect the pixels.
4. **Proofread gate — a dedicated assembly pass.** Hand the final text to a fresh `general` worker whose only job is language: grammar, spelling, punctuation, terminology consistency, and whether the prose reads NATIVELY in the report's own language. It proofreads only and never composes. It returns a defect list; fix every item and re-run the gate on the delta. Deliver only on a clean pass — this gate runs BEFORE the first delivery, not after the user finds the typo.

**Repair is bounded.** After every gate run that found defects, ask `node "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/report-tools.mjs" repair decide --state "$SESSION_DIR/repair-state.json" --defects "$SESSION_DIR/defects.json" --artifact-bytes <bytes> --renders <pages> --session-dir "$SESSION_DIR"` and obey it: `repair` means fix and re-run; `deliver` means stop and ship with the residual defects the manifest now lists; `block` means a content-integrity defect remains (or there is no usable artifact), so do not deliver: tell the user what blocks it and record the row as `failed` with the reason. Never repair past a stop decision (3 attempts, a 2-attempt plateau, an oscillation, or 15 minutes; the reference's section 8).

Then resolve every manifest row (`outcome set <format> delivered --path <file>` or `blocked_capability` / `skipped` / `failed` with `--reason`) and deliver: the artifact plus a compact chat-readable summary of what it says — the answer in a few sentences, the numbers that matter, and what to look at first. The document is the deliverable; the summary is what gets it read.

### The closing briefing — every run ends with it

The last thing the user reads states, in one compact block, what the answer is made of:

- **The printed block.** `node "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/report-tools.mjs" outcome verify --session-dir "$SESSION_DIR" && node "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/report-tools.mjs" outcome finish --session-dir "$SESSION_DIR" && node "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/report-tools.mjs" outcome briefing --session-dir "$SESSION_DIR"`: sources and distinct domains counted from `sources-ledger.md`, elapsed minutes from the session directory's own timestamp, every promised deliverable with its status, the gate results, the residual defects, and the repair summary. A failing `verify` means the run is not done.
- **Effort.** Workers, waves, excursions, and verifications — the same counters as the `SYNTHESIS.md` header — plus how many sources were primary and how many claims went to the unresolved/refuted annex.

Never ship the artifact without this block, and never fill it from memory — paste the printed block and read the rest off the journal.

**Record the format choice.** After delivery, when the harness exposes a memory tool and the run qualifies (the user declared a preference, or made the same unsolicited choice on 2+ runs), append one episode line to `reference/human-report-style.md` in the grammar of the reference's section 5, and update the `system/human/report-style.md` pointer when a generalization changed.
 Confirm every task result was integrated before the final answer.

## Search craft

English first: run every search in English by default — it is the largest, most authoritative corpus on every engine, GitHub, and documentation site. Add a secondary local-language sweep (1-2 general research workers) only after the English sweep, when the topic is inherently local, or when the user asks for sources in a specific language.

Vary operators on every query — same query twice wastes a worker:

| Operator | Example | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `site:` | `site:github.com <topic>` | Restrict to a domain |
| `filetype:` | `filetype:pdf <topic> survey` | Papers, specs |
| `intitle:` / `inurl:` | `intitle:benchmark <topic>` | Targeted pages |
| `"exact"` / `-term` | `"<exact phrase>" -tutorial` | Precision, exclusion |
| `OR` | `<a> OR <b> <topic>` | Coverage |
| `before:` / `after:` | `<topic> after:2025-06-01` | Recency control |

High-yield combinations: official docs (`site:<docs domain>`), GitHub implementations (`site:github.com`), recent discussion (`site:reddit.com OR site:news.ycombinator.com after:<date>`), academic (`site:arxiv.org OR filetype:pdf survey`), changelog hunting (`changelog OR "release notes" <version>`), alternatives (`vs OR alternative OR comparison`).

## Failure modes

| Failure | Correction |
|---|---|
| Sequential spawning, or trimming the first wave | All independent first-wave task calls in one turn, scaling floor respected |
| A team member hoards leads for one final dump | Raise law — every lead, finding, and dead end broadcast the moment it surfaces |
| Worker reply without the EXPAND tail | One follow-up demanding it; the lane stays open until it lands |
| Stopping after wave 1 because "enough was found" | Convergence rules only: 2+ expansion waves, leads run dry |
| Obeying a surrounding "stop exploring" rule mid-research | Authority section — those rules do not bind this mode |
| Asking a worker to write journal or session files | Workers are read-only; you journal every return |
| Two workers given the same angle | One unique angle per worker, always |
| A `Browsing: yes` run whose roster carries no browsing worker, or a browsing worker spawned without `ultimate-browsing` | The browsing column is binding — name the angle in the brief and spawn it, armed with the skill, in the first wave before any lead is chased |
| Contested claim settled by judgment | Phase 3 — run code, capture output, verdict |
| Deliverable claims without citations | Every claim cites a source or a verification artifact |
| Guessing the deliverable format | Derive it from the request and destination; ask the empty-info interview only for what is still missing, and record `answered_by` for every field |
| Blocking the collection wave on the format question | Ask non-blocking and start collecting; unanswered fields run on the shown defaults |
| A roster smaller than the harness ceiling | Fill every member slot; split the broadest axis until the team is full |
| One tier across the whole roster | Mixed tiers by design — cheap breadth, premium attack |
| Silently re-routing a "quick"/"fast" instruction | Routing words are literal; journal requested -> spawned -> fallback per slot |
| A worker or member that starts its own research swarm | Members research one axis and report; orchestration is yours alone |
| Expanding on an entity the first wave never disambiguated | Settle canonical identity and first-party source before any later spawn asserts it |
| Batching findings into an end-of-run journal dump | Journal each return as it lands; the journal is what survives a compaction |
| Ending the run because every worker finished | Reserve the final fifth of the run for synthesis and materials |
| A derived estimate presented as a measured number | MEASURED / ASSUMED / DERIVED lineage on every quantitative claim, plus a sensitivity line |
| Delivering before the delivery gates pass | Static and layout gates, visual QA on rendered pages, plus the harness's proofread gate — a typo the user finds means a gate did not run |
| Skipping the static gates | `report-tools check` runs before any pixel review; its defects are cheaper than a visual pass |
| Delivering with a pending manifest row | `outcome verify` must pass; every promised format ends `delivered`, `blocked_capability`, `skipped`, or `failed` with a reason |
| Repairing past the tracker's stop decision | `repair decide` owns the budget; `deliver` ships with the residual list, `block` stops delivery |
| Guessing a design-spec value the extractor marked `TODO: ask` | Fill it from the interview answers or the reference's defaults, never by guessing |
| Referencing an asset that is not on disk | Verify the asset manifest before rendering; re-render whatever is missing |
| A figure stretched, cropped, or styled off the report's design language | `design-spec.md` binds every asset: fixed containers, contain-fit with aspect preserved, spec fonts and palette in charts and Mermaid |
| Chasing an interesting find with no ENTER trigger | Excursions need a named trigger; everything else stays a queued lead |
| An excursion that never came back, or drifted into a new mission | EXIT rules are unconditional; depth 3 means promote it to an axis or record it as a gap |
| An excursion whose result was never folded back | Every EXIT writes what it changed in the top-level answer, `none` included, and mirrors into the loop ledger |
| Delivering without the closing briefing | Paste the block `outcome briefing` prints; never compute or recall its numbers by hand |
