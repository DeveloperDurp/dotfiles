Four layers (all generic, never site-specific):
  1. Challenge markers (WAF product strings — not site brand names)
  2. Size fingerprints (known bad byte sizes hinted by caller)
  3. Cookie sensor state (e.g. Akamai `_abck=~-1~`)
  4. Caller-supplied success_selectors (strongest positive proof)

Layers 1-3 are "negative proof" (fail fast).
Layer 4 is "positive proof" — without it, HTTP 200 is only a weak success.
