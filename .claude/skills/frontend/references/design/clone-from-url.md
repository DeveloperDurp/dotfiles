# Clone From URL — Runtime Design-System Extraction

Use this when the user gives a **live site or a URL** to clone: "clone aside.com", "rebuild this page", "make it look exactly like `<url>`". A live URL affords what a screenshot cannot — the browser's **runtime truth**. Extract that truth with the real browser, make it the `DESIGN.md` contract, then build reusable primitives against it. Never eyeball a screenshot into a one-off.

## Outcome and stop rule

A `DESIGN.md` whose every token, interaction state, and motion value was read from the running page with `getComputedStyle`, plus a component-level clone that an independent reviewer confirms is an extensible design system (live DOM, reused primitives) — not a screenshot-matched or pasted-image fake. Done is defined by `/visual-qa` reference-fidelity mode passing on fresh evidence, not by your own glance.

## Phase 1 — Extract the runtime truth (never guess a value)

Drive a real browser with omowright from js eval (staged in the `browser` skill): `connectPipe` on a task-owned profile for a public page, `connectCloakProfile` when the source is bot-scored, `connectBrowserSkill()` when it needs the user's login — then `page.evaluate` / `session.evaluate` for `getComputedStyle`. Do NOT parse CSS files — minification, CORS, CSS-in-JS, and Tailwind utilities make source unreliable. `getComputedStyle` returns what the browser ACTUALLY rendered, so it is the only source of truth.

Sweep the page and read, for every meaningful element and every repeated pattern:

- **Tokens** — color, background, border, font family/size/weight, line-height, letter-spacing, radius, shadow, and spacing (padding/margin/gap). Cluster the repeated values into the token scale.
- **Interaction states** — capture `default/hover/focus/active` (plus disabled/loading/empty/error where they exist) by DRIVING the state, then re-reading the computed style. A system with only the resting state is incomplete.
- **Motion** — `transition` (property, duration, timing function, delay), `@keyframes` (walk `document.styleSheets` for `CSSKeyframesRule`), and `transform`. Motion is part of the contract, not decoration.
- **Assets** — `<img>` and background-image URLs, inline SVG, `@font-face` files, video sources. Download the REAL assets; never substitute stock or placeholders.
- **Responsive** — re-run the sweep at 375 / 768 / 1280 and record what actually changes per breakpoint.

A compact sweep payload to inject through the browser's evaluate action (extend the recorded fields as needed):

```js
() => {
  const out = [];
  for (const el of document.querySelectorAll("*")) {
    const s = getComputedStyle(el);
    out.push({
      tag: el.tagName,
      color: s.color, background: s.backgroundColor, border: s.borderColor,
      font: s.fontFamily, size: s.fontSize, weight: s.fontWeight,
      lineHeight: s.lineHeight, letterSpacing: s.letterSpacing,
      radius: s.borderRadius, shadow: s.boxShadow,
      padding: s.padding, margin: s.margin, gap: s.gap,
      transition: s.transition, animation: s.animation, transform: s.transform,
    });
  }
  return out;
}
```

## Phase 2 — Write the DESIGN.md contract

Turn the extraction into `DESIGN.md` per `design-system-architecture.md`: token scales, typography, spacing, the component anatomy with every captured state, the motion rules, and the responsive deltas. Name which source each value came from. If a value is not in `DESIGN.md`, it may not appear in code.

## Phase 3 — Clone-code reusable primitives (one at a time)

Build primitives against the contract, not the screenshot. One component per cycle: implement, render, compare to the source region, fix, then move on. Use the downloaded assets. Never paste a raster or `background-image` where a live element belongs. Never approximate a token you already extracted.

## Phase 4 — Reference-fidelity QA (mandatory, motion included)

Verify through `/visual-qa` in reference-fidelity mode against the source captures, for every page and every breakpoint. Interaction states and animations are IN SCOPE: drive hover/focus/click/scroll, then compare the settled states AND the motion itself against the source. You are not done until the dual-oracle gate passes on fresh evidence.

## Anti-patterns

- Parsing CSS files instead of `getComputedStyle` — the rendered truth is the only source.
- "CORS blocked" as an excuse — computed styles bypass it.
- Resting state only — capture hover/focus/active and the rest.
- Screenshot-matched one-off — build reusable, token-driven primitives.
- Placeholder or stock assets — download and use the originals.
- Desktop only — re-extract at each breakpoint.

## Provenance

This runtime-extraction workflow follows the MIT-licensed **[JCodesMore/ai-website-cloner-template](https://github.com/JCodesMore/ai-website-cloner-template)** clone-website approach: browser automation plus a `getComputedStyle` sweep, state/motion/asset capture, spec files, and visual QA. It is a project-original synthesis, not a copy of that template. Do not treat this file as a license to copy any target site's trademarks, brand assets, logos, or proprietary copy — extract the design *system* (tokens, layout grammar, component anatomy, interaction states, motion) and apply it to the user's own product and content.
