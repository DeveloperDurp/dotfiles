# Frontend Design References — Index

All reference files live flat in this directory. Three layers:
- **Layer 0 — design system architecture** (1 file): the mandatory gate. Defines `DESIGN.md` structure, creation workflow, validation rules. Always loaded by Phase 0 when no design system exists.
- **Layer A — taste skills** (12 files): how to execute. Discipline, motion, spacing, anti-slop, output completeness.
- **Layer B — design systems** (70 files): what it should look like. Brand-specific color/type/component tokens.

**Phase 0 runs first** (check/create `DESIGN.md`), then most non-trivial tasks load **one Layer A + one Layer B** together. See the routing flow in the sibling `README.md`. Specialized phases (interaction and motion, app-shell layout, URL clones, real-product screen research) load the matching project-original operating reference — see the final section of this index.

---

## Layer 0 — Design System Architecture (1)

| File | Purpose | Load when |
|---|---|---|
| `design-system-architecture.md` | Defines the `DESIGN.md` structure — 8 sections plus a greenfield-only `## 0. Research Log` (atmosphere, color tokens, typography scale, spacing system, components, motion, depth, accessibility constraints & accepted debt). Creation workflow for new and existing projects. Validation rules and memory management. | Phase 0 fires and no `DESIGN.md` exists in the project. Also load when extracting a design system from existing code. |

## Layer A — Taste Skills (12)

From [Leonxlnx/taste-skill](https://github.com/Leonxlnx/taste-skill).

### Code-generation skills (write actual frontend code)

| File | Purpose | Load when |
|---|---|---|
| `taste-skill.md` | Default all-rounder. Premium frontend without forcing one narrow visual style. Has 3 dials: DESIGN_VARIANCE, MOTION_INTENSITY, VISUAL_DENSITY. | The user wants a "good-looking" website/app and gives no specific aesthetic direction. Safe default. |
| `gpt-tasteskill.md` | Stricter, more opinionated. High-variance layouts, stronger GSAP motion, more aggressive anti-slop. Tuned for GPT/Codex. | The user wants something genuinely *Awwwards-tier* — bold layouts, magnetic interactions, scroll-triggered scenes. Or `taste-skill.md` results felt "too safe". |
| `image-to-code-skill.md` | Image-first workflow: generate premium reference images → analyze → implement to match. | The user says "generate the design first, then code it", or visual quality is the main challenge. Pair with `imagegen-frontend-web.md`. |
| `redesign-skill.md` | Audits existing UI and surgically fixes weak layout, spacing, hierarchy, color, type. Does NOT rewrite from scratch. | Existing project + "make this better", "improve the UI", "redesign", "this looks bad". DO NOT use on greenfield. |
| `soft-skill.md` | Polished, calm, expensive-looking. Softer contrast, generous whitespace, premium fonts (Geist, Inter Display), spring motion. | The user says "premium", "luxurious", "calm", "expensive", "spa", "wellness", "boutique", "editorial". Or shows references like Linear, Vercel, Stripe, Apple marketing. |
| `minimalist-skill.md` | Editorial product UI inspired by Notion/Linear. Restrained monochrome palette, crisp structure, generous whitespace. | The user says "minimal", "clean", "Notion-style", "Linear-style", "editorial", "boring is good", "remove decoration". |
| `brutalist-skill.md` | BETA. Mechanical visual language. Swiss typography, sharp contrast, raw structure, experimental composition. | The user says "brutalist", "raw", "Swiss", "experimental", "industrial", "unstyled", "anti-design". |
| `output-skill.md` | Pushes for complete output: no placeholder comments, no `// TODO`, no skipped implementation, no half-done components. | Stack on top of any other skill when the agent has been lazy or the user complains "you keep leaving things undone". Do not use alone. |
| `stitch-skill.md` | Google Stitch-compatible semantic design rules. Includes the extra DESIGN.md export format; a complete worked export ships alongside as `stitch-design-example.md`. | The user is working with Google Stitch, or explicitly wants Stitch-format output, or wants a DESIGN.md alongside the code. |

### Image-generation skills (do NOT write code, only produce reference imagery)

| File | Purpose | Load when |
|---|---|---|
| `imagegen-frontend-web.md` | Generates Awwwards-level website design reference *images*. Strong typography, generous spacing, anti-slop visual discipline. | "Generate a mockup", "design reference image", "show me what it could look like", before any code. Pair with `image-to-code-skill.md` for the full image-to-code flow. |
| `imagegen-frontend-mobile.md` | Generates premium mobile app screen concepts and flows. iOS, Android, cross-platform. Phone mockup framing, multi-screen consistency. | Mobile app screen mockups, app flow images, iOS/Android UI references — image only, no code. |
| `imagegen-brandkit.md` | Generates premium brand-kit overview images: logo concepts, color systems, typography specimens, mockups, identity boards. | Brand identity moodboard, logo direction, full brand-kit board. Image only. |

### Layer A stacking rules

1. **At most one *style* skill at a time** (`taste-skill`, `gpt-tasteskill`, `minimalist-skill`, `brutalist-skill`, `soft-skill`, `redesign-skill`, `image-to-code-skill`). They encode opposite philosophies — picking two creates contradictions.
2. **`output-skill.md` and `stitch-skill.md` stack on top of any style skill.** They add discipline and output format, not visual direction.
3. **`image-to-code-skill.md` pairs with one imagegen skill** for the full flow.
4. **Imagegen skills are image-only.** Do not load them when the user actually wants code.

## Operating references — interaction, layout, and research workflows (project-original)

Beyond the 12-file Layer A library, the design ruleset carries project-original operating references for specialized phases. They stack on the routed Layer A + Layer B pair; they never replace a style skill, and they are not counted in the library totals above.

| File | Purpose | Load when |
|---|---|---|
| `interaction-skill.md` | Interaction mechanics anchored to the beui.dev catalog: find the nearest pattern, read its real source through the curl recipe, extract the mechanism (spring config, layout strategy, enter/exit order, reduced-motion path), and adapt it to `DESIGN.md` motion tokens. | Any work adding or changing interaction or motion — micro-interactions, animated components, transitions, gestures, hover/press/state feedback, loading/success/error morphs, "make it feel alive". |
| `ambience-skill.md` | Ambience mechanics anchored to the react-bits catalog: hero atmosphere and animated backgrounds, typographic reveals, scroll chapters, card surface effects. Find the nearest pattern in its intent map, read the source through the curl recipe, extract the mechanism, and run the retrofit checklist (reduced-motion static state, off-screen pause, compositor-only, tokens, budget). Cursor effects are quarantined to `gpt-tasteskill.md` briefs. | Any work adding a hero atmosphere, animated or shader background, text reveal (split, blur, shimmer, typewriter, count-up, marquee), scroll storytelling, or spotlight / tilt / glare / glowing-border cards. |
| `layout-skill.md` | Layout mechanics: scroll ownership, the two silent CSS contracts, named primitives, content-stress matrix. Zero visual direction. | App shells, dashboards, split panes, or a layout that breaks under real content. |
| `lazyweb.md` | Curl-only real-product screen research for design direction. | Greenfield design research lanes. |
| `stylegallery.md` | Curl-only lookup of named spatial pattern contracts: primary problem, constraints, scroll ownership, anti-patterns. | A concrete spatial problem needs a documented pattern, alongside `layout-skill.md` mechanics. |
| `clone-from-url.md` | Runtime extraction workflow (browser + `getComputedStyle`) for cloning a named site. | A live site or URL is the visual reference. |

## Layer B — Design Systems (70)

Most Layer B files are materialized from [VoltAgent/awesome-design-md](https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-design-md), based on [Google Stitch DESIGN.md format](https://stitch.withgoogle.com/docs/design-md/overview/). Project-original entries such as `aside.md` are listed here only when `ATTRIBUTION.md` and `frontend-refs-manifest.mjs` mark them as original. Each file captures one website's complete visual language: color palette, typography, components, layout principles, depth, do/don't, responsive behavior, and an agent prompt guide.

### How to use

When the user says **"make it look like [Brand]"**, **"[Brand]-style"**, **"like [Brand]'s site"**, or shows that brand's site as a reference, load the corresponding `<brand>.md` file and treat it as the project's design system. Combine with one Layer A taste-skill for execution discipline.

Each file ships with: visual theme, hex color palette + semantic roles, full type hierarchy, button/card/input/nav specs with hover/active states, spacing scale, shadow system, do/don't list, breakpoints, and a ready-to-use agent prompt.
