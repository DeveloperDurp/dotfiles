# Draft: ${slug}

## Affected user and ideal state
<!-- Who this output touches (a customer, another programmer, a program or agent consuming it - often more than one) and how each uses it today and will use it after. -->
<!-- IS-n | property of the ideal state: nothing snags, feels odd, regresses, or degrades for them | reason -->
<!-- GAP-n | difference between IS-n and today | reason | closed by todo(s) -->

## Components (topology ledger)
<!-- Lock the SHAPE before depth. One row per top-level component that can succeed or fail independently. -->
<!-- id | outcome (one line) | status: active|deferred | evidence path -->

## Open assumptions (announced defaults)
<!-- ${assumptionsNote} -->
<!-- assumption | adopted default | rationale | reversible? -->

## Findings (cited - path:lines)

## Decisions (with rationale)

## Scope IN

## Scope OUT (Must NOT have)

## Open questions

## Approval gate
status: drafting
<!-- When exploration is exhausted and unknowns are answered, set status: awaiting-approval. -->
<!-- That durable record is the loop guard: on a later turn read it and resume at the gate instead of re-running exploration. -->

## TL;DR (For humans)
<!-- Fill this LAST, after the detailed plan below is written, so it summarizes the REAL plan. -->
<!-- Plain English for a non-engineer: NO file paths, NO todo numbers, NO wave/agent/tool names. -->

**Who this is for and what changes for them:** <fill last - the affected user and their experience after, 1-2 sentences>

**What you'll get:** <fill last - deliverables in human terms, 1-2 sentences>

**Why this approach:** <fill last - the one or two load-bearing decisions and why>

**What it will NOT do:** <fill last - 1-3 plain lines mirroring Must NOT have>

**Effort:** <Quick | Short | Medium | Large | XL>
<!-- Effort is exactly ONE band, never hours/days. Quick = single edit, minutes of agent work; Short = one focused change, a few files; Medium = multi-file feature in one session; Large = several waves, one long session; XL = multi-session or architectural work. A written duration is rewritten to a band. -->
**Risk:** <Low | Medium | High> - <one-line driver>

## Scope
### Affected user and ideal state
<!-- From the draft ledger: who this touches and how they use the result, then one IS row per property with its reason, then one GAP row per difference with its reason. Every todo below closes a GAP row; ## Success criteria proves every IS row. -->
**Affected user:** <who, and how they use it today and after>

| Row | Statement | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| IS-1 | <what the user does, sees, or never has break> | <why this is the ideal for them> |
| GAP-1 | <how today differs from IS-1> | <why it matters to them> |

### Must have
### Must NOT have (guardrails, anti-slop, scope boundaries)

## Verification strategy
> Zero human intervention - all verification is agent-executed.
- Test decision: <TDD | tests-after | none> + framework
- Evidence: `.opencode/evidence/task-<N>-${slug}.<ext>`

## Execution strategy
### Parallel execution waves
> Target 5-8 todos per wave. Fewer than 3 (except the final) means you under-split.

### Dependency matrix
| Todo | Depends on | Blocks | Can parallelize with |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Todos
> Implementation + Test = ONE todo. Never separate.
<!-- APPEND TASK BATCHES BELOW THIS LINE WITH edit/apply_patch - never rewrite the headers above. -->

  What to do / Must NOT do: <...>

  QA scenarios (name the exact tool + invocation): happy + failure, Evidence <attemptDir>/task-1-${slug}.<ext>

## Final verification wave
> Runs in parallel after ALL todos. ALL must APPROVE. Surface results and wait for the user's explicit okay before declaring complete.

## Commit strategy

## Success criteria
> One row per IS row. The plan is complete only when every IS row has a delivering todo and a proving QA scenario; F4 checks the delivered behavior against these rows 1:1, and a shortfall becomes new \`- [ ] N.\` rows, never a note.
| IS | Delivering todo(s) | Proving QA scenario | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| IS-1 | <N> | <scenario name from todo N> | <attemptDir>/task-<N>-${slug}.<ext> |
