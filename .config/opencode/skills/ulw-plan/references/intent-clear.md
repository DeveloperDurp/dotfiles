# ulw-plan - CLEAR intent

Read this when INTENT ROUTING resolved to CLEAR: the user knows the desired outcome and the only open items are preferences/tradeoffs the repo cannot answer. Also entered from the on-the-fence tie-break (ask exactly one question).

<stance>
The user owns the outcome; genuine forks exist that only they can decide. Research first to ground, THEN ask the surviving forks. You are a peer asking only what you genuinely cannot resolve - not an interrogator gathering a feature list. High-accuracy review is optional only when `review_required` is false; if the user already asked for high accuracy, run the review after approval instead of offering it.
</stance>

<research_protocol>
Explore-before-asking. Dispatch parallel read-only research in one turn - internal patterns/conventions/test infra, plus external docs/contracts - and use direct read/grep/ast/lsp while it runs. Facts-vs-decisions triage in FRONT of the two filters: if the repo/system/docs can answer it, explore and present a cited confirmation, never a question; if only the user can answer it, it may proceed to the interview; if you cannot tell who answers it, treat it as a user-decision. Stop at sufficiency (clearance answerable), one wave per open question; never re-explore to double-check.
</research_protocol>

<interview>
TOPOLOGY LOCK first: from the request plus exploration, enumerate the 1-6 top-level components that can each succeed or fail independently, confirm them in ONE turn, and record them in the draft's Components ledger (id, one-line outcome, status, evidence path). Do NOT collapse to one component because the request looks small.

Then the TWO FILTERS (full definition in SKILL.md): (1) evidence-answerable -> explore; (2) the ideal state for the affected user - or, failing that, intent plus a defensible default - settles it -> resolve and record, EXCEPT owner-decisions (irreversible / destructive / safety-critical, or cross-cutting product choices), which always survive as questions.

ASK WITH WHY: name what you explored, why it did not resolve, and which part of the plan forks on the answer. 1-3 narrow questions per turn, each with 2-4 options and your recommended default FIRST; a skipped question resolves to that default. Always confirm test strategy (TDD / tests-after / none - agent-executed QA is always included).

FOGGIEST-GAP targeting (ordinal, NO numbers): each turn aim at the single open gap whose resolution most unblocks the plan, and say why in one sentence; rotate across equally-foggy components. End every turn with the question or the explicit next step - never passive.

CLEARANCE CHECK after each turn: affected user named, ideal-state and gap rows recorded? objective defined? scope IN/OUT explicit? approach decided? test strategy confirmed? constraints swept (budget / stack / scale / audience - each explored, defaulted, or asked)? no blocking ambiguity left? Any NO is your next question; all YES -> present the approval brief and stop.
</interview>

<approval_and_deliver>
Run the durable approval gate (mechanics in `full-workflow.md`): present the brief once with findings (paths), the approach, and EVERY surviving owner-decision as an explicit question with your recommended option (a skipped one resolves to that default); then wait for the user's explicit okay. If "start now, or review first?" would be your ONLY question, you have defaulted forks you should have surfaced - list them first. After approval: scaffold the files, run mandatory gap analysis, APPEND the todos, fill the human TL;DR last. Then either run the dual high-accuracy review if `review_required: true`, or present the handoff explanation (full-workflow.md Phase 4 format) and ask ONE question - start work now, or run the dual high-accuracy review first? Never pick for the user when review was not requested; never begin execution.
</approval_and_deliver>

<worked_example>
Request: "add a 5/min-per-IP rate-limit to `/login`".
1. Explore -> auth middleware at `src/auth/login.ts:40`, an existing limiter util at `src/util/rate-limit.ts`, Redis client at `src/redis.ts`.
2. Affected user and ideal state: a person signing in through a balancer that spreads them over several nodes; IS rows - one count per IP across nodes, an over-limit reply that says when to retry, a legitimate user never sees a reset or a silent drop. Topology lock (one turn): one active component - "login rate-limit".
3. One fork the ideal state settles, recorded not asked: storage backend = Redis (one count across nodes; in-memory would reset per node). One surviving owner-decision, asked WITH WHY:
   - Over-limit response (default = 429 + Retry-After; options 429 / 423 / silent drop) - why: a client contract the user lives with.
   - Swept axes: no budget/audience fork (internal service); scale bound = existing Redis capacity (defaulted, reversible).
4. Approval brief -> explicit okay -> scaffold -> append todos -> if `review_required`, run dual review and deliver receipts; otherwise deliver with the optional review question.
