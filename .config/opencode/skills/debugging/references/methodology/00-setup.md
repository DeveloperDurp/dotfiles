# Phase 0 + 1 — Environment Assessment & Journal Setup

Before a debugger touches anything, you need a map of what's running and a ledger of what you'll touch. Skipping either phase is how debug sessions turn into "why is my repo dirty a week later" sessions.

---

## Phase 0 — Environment Assessment

Map the ground truth before you attach. Attaching the wrong way wastes the first hour.

### 1. Identify the runtime

Read the actual manifest file, don't guess from extensions:

- Python → `pyproject.toml`, `requirements*.txt`, `setup.py`, `uv.lock`, `.python-version`
- Node → `package.json` (check `scripts`, check `engines`, check `type: module`)
- Rust → `Cargo.toml`, `rust-toolchain*`
- Go → `go.mod`, `go.sum`
- Native / mixed → `Makefile`, `CMakeLists.txt`, the binary itself (`file <path>`)

### 2. Load the matching runtime reference

The moment you know the runtime, open `references/runtimes/<runtime>.md`. The commands in this phase (and every phase after) are runtime-specific. The shape of the answers is the same; the commands are not.

### 3. Gather observable environment state

The shape of the answers you need (commands in the runtime reference):

| Question | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| What binary/interpreter/runtime actually launches the process? | Determines debugger flag plumbing. Wrappers (`tsx`, `poetry run`, `cargo run`, `bun`, supervisor scripts) change how flags propagate. |
| Is there already a debug-relevant port in use, or another instance of the service running? | Either attach to it or kill it deliberately — never silently compete. |
| Are symbols / source maps / debug info present and correct? | This determines whether breakpoints land on the right lines. Compiled-but-not-debug builds, stripped binaries, and incomplete source maps all silently misplace breakpoints. |
| Does the code path require env vars, config files, or auth tokens to reach the bug? | Missing env often produces early-return paths that masquerade as the bug itself. |
| Is there an existing failing test or known repro? | Prefer amplifying an existing repro over inventing one. |
| Are watchers (file watchers, hot reloaders, supervisors) going to restart the process mid-session? | If yes, turn them off before attaching. Restarts drop inspector connections and invalidate breakpoints. |

### Output budget

**Bound every inspection before you run it; unbounded output destroys the investigation's working context.**
- Set a frame count, element count, or byte range for every query.
- Prefer one targeted query over one broad dump: ask for the value that distinguishes hypotheses.
- Page through more data only when the first bounded result says it is necessary; do not re-dump the whole object.
- Treat any command whose output size you cannot predict as a command that needs a limit.
- Before: GDB `bt` — After: GDB `bt 10` to inspect only the top ten frames.
- Before: LLDB `memory read 0x1000` — After: `memory read 0x1000 -c 32` for a bounded byte range.
- Before: LLDB `frame variable` — After: `frame variable --children-count 10 user` for one variable's children.
- This is not presentation etiquette: a flooded context hides the decisive observation and can end the investigation.

### 4. Gate check

If any answer is "I'm not sure", you are not ready for Phase 1. Investigate until certain. Guessing here cascades into false-positive hypotheses in Phase 2.

## Phase 1 — Journal Setup

Open **one** journal file at the project root: `.debug-journal.md`. Single source of truth for every artifact this skill creates. The contract with the user that you can undo everything.

### Exclude from git (don't pollute the committed ignore list)

```bash
grep -qx '.debug-journal.md' .git/info/exclude || echo '.debug-journal.md' >> .git/info/exclude
```

`.git/info/exclude` is per-clone and not committed — perfect for local-session artifacts.

### Journal template

```markdown
# Debug Journal — <short bug name>
Started: <ISO timestamp>
Goal: <one-sentence user request>

## Environment snapshot (Phase 0)
- Runtime: <language + version + launcher>
- Entry: <command that starts the process>
- Ports / sockets: <app=..., debugger=..., etc>
- Git HEAD: <sha>, working tree clean? <yes/no>
- References read: <list the files from references/ you loaded — proves you did the gate>

## Hypotheses
1. [STATUS] <hypothesis> — distinguishing evidence: <what would confirm/refute> — if true, fix is: <two words>
2. ...

## Failed hypothesis round counter
- Round 1: <result>
- Round 2: <result>
<!-- At 2 consecutive failures, invoke Oracle Triple (see 04-oracle-triple.md). -->

## Artifacts to revert
<!-- Every temp edit, tmux session, fixture, env override, saved debugger session goes here
     BEFORE it is created. The rule is journal-then-modify. -->
- [ ] `src/foo.py` — added `breakpoint()` on 2 lines. Revert: `git checkout src/foo.py`
- [ ] tmux session `debug-server`. Kill: `tmux kill-session -t debug-server`
- [ ] `/tmp/debug-payload.json`. Remove: `rm /tmp/debug-payload.json`
- [ ] env var in current shell: `FOO_BASE_URL=...`. Unset when done.
- [ ] GDB session save: `~/ghidra-projects/scratch.gzf`. Remove if not promoting.

## Findings
<!-- Append observed values here with timestamp. Verbatim only, no paraphrasing. -->

## Oracle Triple (if invoked)
<!-- One subsection per Oracle round, with the synthesized new hypothesis set. -->

## Final fix
<!-- File paths + test path. Filled during Phase 7. -->
```

### The journal-then-modify rule

Before any modification to the repo, shell, or system state, append to "Artifacts to revert" first. This one discipline is what prevents debug sessions from becoming git cleanup sessions.

If you catch yourself about to run a command that creates a file, opens a port, or modifies source — stop, journal the intended artifact with its revert command, then run the command. Not the other way around.

### Why a single journal (not scattered TODO comments)

- One `git checkout`, one `rm`, one `tmux kill-session` list — simple Phase 9 walk.
- Survives interruptions. If you get pulled away mid-session, the next agent (or you later) can continue or revert without guessing.
- Prevents the most common failure: leaving `console.log`/`print()`/`dbg!` scattered across the tree.
