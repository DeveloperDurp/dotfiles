# Native Binary Debugging (No Source / Reverse Engineering)

For binaries where you don't have trustworthy source: stripped production builds, third-party closed libs, malware, CTF challenges, firmware, vendored libs whose docs lie. The workflow is specific; doing it out of order wastes days.

This reference **coordinates** the triage and dynamic work. The heavy tools each have their own reference:
- **Static decompilation** → [tools/ghidra.md](../tools/ghidra.md)
- **Interactive debugging** → [tools/pwndbg.md](../tools/pwndbg.md)
- **Scripted interaction / exploitation** → [tools/pwntools.md](../tools/pwntools.md)

Read those before using them — especially Ghidra, which has a surprising amount of workflow that's not obvious.

---

## ⚠️ STOP — is this actually a stripped C/C++ binary?

A growing share of "binaries" are actually **bundled high-level apps** — Bun SEA, Node SEA, Deno compile, pkg, nexe, Electron, Tauri, PyInstaller. Their workflow is completely different: the high-level source is recoverable with the right per-bundler tool (often plaintext, sometimes V8 cache / `.pyc` / eszip needing extra tooling), and Ghidra against the runtime VM wastes hours.

Quick check:

```bash
file ./target                                                    # Mach-O / ELF / PE - inconclusive
du -h ./target                                                   # 50 MB+ for a "simple CLI" → suspect bundled
strings -n 12 ./target | rg -iE 'bun|node_modules|webpack|esbuild|deno|pkg/lib|electron|pyinstaller|nexe|NODE_SEA_FUSE|tauri' | head -5
```

**If any hits** → close this file, open [bundled-js-binary.md](bundled-js-binary.md) instead. Following the Ghidra/pwndbg path on a bundled-app binary wastes hours decompiling the runtime VM while the app-level bundle is recoverable with the right per-bundler tool (plaintext for Bun/pkg/nexe/Electron-asar; eszip / V8-cache / `.pyc` for Deno / Node SEA / PyInstaller).

If `file` says "Mach-O" or "ELF", `du` is < 20 MB, and the strings check is empty → continue here.

---

## The workflow (do these in order)

Every step's output is input to the next. Skipping steps means guessing later.

```
  [1] Triage           →  what kind of binary is this?
  [2] Dynamic tracing  →  what syscalls / libcalls does it make?
  [3] Static analysis  →  what does it DO, in readable form? (Ghidra)
  [4] Dynamic debug    →  confirm hypotheses at runtime (pwndbg)
  [5] Scripted repro   →  lock the bug with a pwntools script
  [6] TDD + fix / report
```

Steps 1 and 2 are fast (minutes). Step 3 is slow (tens of minutes to hours depending on size). Don't skip 1-2 and go straight to Ghidra — the triage output tells you what to focus on inside Ghidra.

---

## [1] Triage — 5-minute fingerprint

```bash
# Basic identity
file ./target
#   elf, mach-o, pe? 32/64-bit? dynamically linked? stripped?

# Architecture details
readelf -h ./target                    # ELF header: entry point, arch, type
lipo -info ./target 2>/dev/null        # macOS: universal binary?

# Interesting strings (often leaks function names, error messages, URLs, API keys)
strings -n 8 ./target | head -100
strings -n 8 ./target | grep -iE '(http|/api/|error|debug|version)'

# Imported symbols (what does it link against?)
nm -D ./target 2>/dev/null              # dynamic symbols
objdump -T ./target 2>/dev/null         # same, alternate tool
readelf -d ./target                     # dynamic section (NEEDED libs)
ldd ./target 2>/dev/null                # resolved library paths

# Security posture (affects what exploits / bugs are possible)
checksec --file=./target                # requires pwntools or installing checksec
#   NX, PIE, RELRO, stack canary, FORTIFY

# Is it stripped?
nm ./target 2>/dev/null | head          # empty? stripped. full? not stripped.
file ./target                           # will say "stripped" or "not stripped"
```

### ⚠️ `strings -n N` silently drops short content

`strings` prints runs of printable characters of length **≥ N**. With `-n 8`, **anything shorter than 8 chars sandwiched between non-printable bytes is dropped silently**. This includes:

- Short identifier interpolations in templates (`${x}`, `${i}`, `${R}`)
- Short embedded constants (`v3`, `null`, integer immediates as bytes)
- Short error codes between binary padding

Real example: a JavaScript template literal `<INSTRUCTIONS>\n${x}\n</INSTRUCTIONS>` came out of `strings -n 8` as `<INSTRUCTIONS>\n</INSTRUCTIONS>` — the `${x}` (4 chars) was dropped. A consumer reading the dump would conclude the template was empty. It is not.

**Use `strings` only for fingerprinting (Phase 1).** For any extraction whose correctness matters, **read bytes directly**:

```bash
# Count occurrences of a needle
LC_ALL=C grep -aoc 'NEEDLE' ./target

# Find offsets
LC_ALL=C grep -aob 'NEEDLE' ./target | head

# Or via Python for byte-precise context
python3 -c "
import sys
data = open('./target','rb').read()
needle = b'NEEDLE'
pos = data.find(needle)
print(repr(data[max(0,pos-100):pos+200]))
"
```

If you must keep using `strings`, lower the threshold: `strings -n 1 -t x ./target | rg ...`. The signal-to-noise drops sharply but short content is preserved.

### Sanitizer build for a crashing C/C++ binary

If the binary can be rebuilt from C/C++ sources, reproduce the crash with sanitizers before
trying to infer the fault from stripped machine code. AddressSanitizer catches out-of-bounds
accesses and use-after-free; UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer reports undefined operations.

```bash
# Rebuild with source locations and runtime checks enabled
CFLAGS='-g -O1 -fsanitize=address,undefined' \
CXXFLAGS='-g -O1 -fsanitize=address,undefined' \
make clean all
./target
```

The sanitizer report identifies the invalid access and its allocation/free or undefined
operation stack, often making the root cause clear before dynamic analysis. For a binary
that cannot be rebuilt, continue with the native tracing and debugger workflow below.

Write the triage summary to the journal:

```markdown
## Binary triage
- Type: <ELF 64-bit, dynamically linked, stripped>
- Arch: <x86_64 | arm64 | ...>
- Libs: <libc, openssl, libcurl>
- Security: <NX, PIE, Partial RELRO, no canary>
- Interesting strings: <short list>
- First hypothesis surface: <which function / area looks most relevant>
```

## [2] Dynamic tracing — what does it actually call?

These are cheap — run them before Ghidra to orient yourself.

### Linux: strace + ltrace

```bash
# System calls
strace -f -o trace.out ./target arg1 arg2
strace -f -e trace=network ./target           # filter to network syscalls
strace -f -e trace=file ./target              # filter to file ops

# Library calls (less useful when stripped but still informative)
ltrace -f -o ltrace.out ./target
ltrace -f -e 'str*+mem*' ./target             # filter to string/mem functions
```

### macOS: Mach-O specifics

**SIP block reality check.** With System Integrity Protection enabled (default on every modern macOS), `dtruss` / `dtrace` will **silently fail** to attach to:
- Anything in `/usr`, `/bin`, `/sbin`, `/System`
- Apple-signed binaries (Xcode CLT, Homebrew formulae from Apple-distributed taps)
- Notarized vendor binaries (Bun, Deno, Docker Desktop, etc.)

`dtruss ./target` will appear to run but produce zero events. This is not a bug; it is the SIP design. Disabling SIP requires a Recovery Mode reboot — usually not worth it. Use the alternatives below.

```bash
# dtruss — works only when SIP allows it (your own unsigned binaries)
sudo dtruss -f ./target 2>&1 | head -20         # equivalent to strace
# If output is suspiciously empty → SIP blocked it. Switch to lldb or app-level logging.
```

**Mach-O metadata inspection (no SIP issues, no debugger needed):**

```bash
# Architecture and slices
file ./target                                    # arm64 / x86_64 / universal
lipo -info ./target                              # which architectures included
lipo -thin arm64 ./target -output ./target-arm64 # extract one slice for analysis

# Headers & load commands (segments, dylibs, code-signature pointer)
otool -h ./target                                # Mach header (cputype, ncmds, flags)
otool -l ./target | head -100                    # load commands; entitlements live in code-signature blob, see codesign below

# Dynamic library dependencies (macOS equivalent of ldd)
otool -L ./target                                # linked dylibs with versions
dyld_info ./target                               # macOS 13+, more detailed than otool -L

# Disassembly
otool -tv ./target | head -200                   # quick disassembly without Ghidra
otool -tV ./target                               # with symbol-resolved branches

# Imported / exported symbols (Apple `nm`, NOT GNU)
nm -u ./target                                   # undefined references = imports
nm -gU ./target                                  # external defined = exports
# Note: GNU `-D`/dynamic flags are not honored on Apple `nm`; use the above forms.
symbols -fullSourcePath -onlyWithDebugInfo ./target  # if any debug info survives

# Code signature & entitlements (entitlements come from codesign, NOT otool)
codesign -dv --entitlements :- ./target 2>&1     # signature info + entitlements XML on stdout
spctl --assess --type execute -vv ./target       # Gatekeeper assessment

# Cert chain — extract to a temp dir to avoid creating files named -0/-1 in cwd
tmp=$(mktemp -d)
codesign -dvv --extract-certificates="$tmp/cert" ./target 2>&1
ls -la "$tmp"
# rm -rf "$tmp"  # journal first, clean up later

# Strings inside specific segments only (less noise than full-binary strings)
otool -s __TEXT __cstring ./target               # C string section
otool -s __TEXT __const ./target                 # constants section
```

**Interactive debugging on macOS — use `lldb`, not `gdb`.**

GDB on macOS requires a self-signed code-signing certificate (`codesign --entitlements gdb.entitlements --sign gdb-cert /opt/homebrew/bin/gdb`) and even then is unreliable on arm64. **Use `lldb` directly** — it ships with Xcode CLT and works without configuration.

```bash
# Start lldb
lldb ./target

# Set arguments
(lldb) settings set target.run-args arg1 arg2

# Run with breakpoints
(lldb) breakpoint set --name function_name        # symbol-based
(lldb) breakpoint set --address 0x1000034c0       # address-based
(lldb) breakpoint set --regex '.*decode.*'         # regex over symbols

# Run / step / inspect
(lldb) run
(lldb) bt                                          # backtrace
(lldb) frame variable                              # locals
(lldb) register read                               # all registers
(lldb) memory read --size 8 --format x --count 16 $sp   # 16 qwords from stack
(lldb) disassemble --frame                         # current function
(lldb) image list                                  # loaded modules
(lldb) image lookup -a 0x1000034c0                 # which module + symbol owns this address

# Process attach to running process
(lldb) process attach --pid 12345
(lldb) process attach --name target               # attach by name

# Print Mach-O specific
(lldb) image dump sections ./target
(lldb) image dump symtab ./target
```

### Data watchpoints — catch the corruption, not just the crash

When a value is already wrong by the time execution reaches the crash, watch the memory
address for writes and stop at the instruction that corrupts it. Use the address of the
field or buffer identified from the static/dynamic hypothesis; see [tools/pwndbg.md](../tools/pwndbg.md)
for the richer pwndbg watchpoint workflow rather than duplicating it here.

```text
# lldb: watch writes to an address (replace with a valid expression/address)
(lldb) watchpoint set expression -- <addr>

# gdb: stop on writes, or on reads when a read is the first observable symptom
(gdb) watch *(<type> *)<addr>
(gdb) rwatch *(<type> *)<addr>
```

A watchpoint is most useful after narrowing the suspect object: continue from its
allocation or initialization, and inspect the backtrace and writer when it triggers.
Hardware watchpoint slots are limited, so remove broad watchpoints before adding more.

**Function interception via `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES`** (macOS equivalent of `LD_PRELOAD`):

```bash
# Build a shim dylib that overrides specific functions
# Then run target with it preloaded
DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=./shim.dylib DYLD_FORCE_FLAT_NAMESPACE=1 ./target
```

DYLD_INSERT works in the unrestricted case but is blocked in three distinct scenarios — distinguish them when diagnosing why your shim didn't load:

1. **SIP / restricted process** (target has the `__RESTRICT,__restrict` section, is setuid/setgid, or is a platform/Apple-signed binary): dyld unconditionally strips all `DYLD_*` env vars before the process starts. Nothing you set will reach the target.
2. **Hardened runtime + library validation** (`CS_RUNTIME` flag set, `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation` entitlement absent): the process accepts `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES` but **rejects** loading any dylib that isn't signed by the same Team ID or by Apple. Symptom: shim is found but not loaded; check `log show --predicate 'eventMessage CONTAINS "library validation failed"'`.
3. **Notarization / Gatekeeper translocation**: the binary may be running from a translocated path; relative paths in `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES` won't resolve. Use absolute paths.

Check each:

```bash
# Restrict segment present? (case 1)
otool -l ./target | grep -A2 __RESTRICT
# Hardened runtime flag? (case 2)
codesign -d --verbose=4 ./target 2>&1 | grep -iE 'flags=|CodeDirectory'
# Look for "0x10000(runtime)" or similar in the flags line.
# Disable-library-validation entitlement?
codesign -d --entitlements :- ./target 2>&1 | grep disable-library-validation
```

**App-level debug logging (always works, ignores SIP):**

When debugger attach is blocked, fall back to maximizing the app's own logging:

```bash
# Try common patterns
APP_DEBUG=1 APP_LOG_LEVEL=debug APP_LOG_FILE=/tmp/trace.log ./target
NSDebugEnabled=YES ./target                       # Cocoa apps
OS_ACTIVITY_MODE=debug ./target                   # os_log subsystem

# Then read os_log unified logging stream live
log stream --predicate 'process == "target"' --level debug

# Or extract historical logs
log show --predicate 'process == "target"' --last 1h --info --debug
```

This is the **partial-runtime-evidence path** for macOS. See [methodology/partial-runtime-evidence.md](../methodology/partial-runtime-evidence.md) for how to combine app-level logs with static analysis when wire-level capture is blocked.

**Network capture on macOS (TLS-decrypted):**

```bash
# 1. Find the active network service (don't assume "Wi-Fi"):
#    Map the default-route interface to the matching networksetup service name.
networksetup -listallnetworkservices                        # show options
DEFAULT_IF=$(route -n get default 2>/dev/null | awk '/interface:/ {print $2}')
echo "Default-route interface: $DEFAULT_IF"
# Match the interface (en0, en1, ...) back to a service name:
SERVICE=$(networksetup -listallhardwareports | awk -v iface="$DEFAULT_IF" '
  /^Hardware Port:/ { hp = substr($0, index($0,$3)) }
  /^Device:/        { if ($2 == iface) print hp }
')
if [ -z "$SERVICE" ]; then
  echo "Could not auto-detect active service. Pick one from -listallnetworkservices manually." >&2
  echo "Aborting proxy setup." >&2
  false  # signal failure but stay safe at top level
else
  echo "Using service: $SERVICE"
fi

# 2. JOURNAL the original proxy state before changing it (REQUIRED for safe rollback):
networksetup -getwebproxy "$SERVICE"        # save this output to journal
networksetup -getsecurewebproxy "$SERVICE"  # save this too

# 3. Start mitmproxy with persistent CA at ~/.mitmproxy/
mitmproxy --listen-host 127.0.0.1 --listen-port 8888 &

# 4. Trust the mitmproxy CA system-wide if the target uses URLSession or any framework
# that ignores HTTPS_PROXY/SSL_CERT_FILE (most macOS-native apps do):
sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain ~/.mitmproxy/mitmproxy-ca-cert.pem

# 5. Two routing options. Try env-var first; fall back to system proxy:
# 5a. Apps that honor env vars (most CLIs):
HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:8888 SSL_CERT_FILE=~/.mitmproxy/mitmproxy-ca-cert.pem ./target ...

# 5b. Apps that use URLSession / system network config (most GUI apps, Bun, some CLIs):
networksetup -setwebproxy "$SERVICE" 127.0.0.1 8888
networksetup -setsecurewebproxy "$SERVICE" 127.0.0.1 8888

# 6. Cleanup — RESTORE original state from journal, untrust CA:
networksetup -setwebproxystate "$SERVICE" off
networksetup -setsecurewebproxystate "$SERVICE" off
sudo security delete-certificate -c "mitmproxy" /Library/Keychains/System.keychain
```

**Critical**: forgetting step 6 leaves all your subsequent traffic mis-routed and silently MITM-able. Journal every step.

### What to look for

| Observation | Hypothesis |
|---|---|
| `open("/etc/secret-config", ...)` | Reads unexpected config; look at what it does with contents |
| `connect(... 1.2.3.4:443)` | Phones home or depends on an external service |
| `getenv("FOO")` returning NULL | Env var expected but not set |
| Repeated `poll`/`epoll_wait` with no progress | Stuck on I/O; check downstream |
| `SIGSEGV` caught by signal handler | Custom crash recovery — often hides the real bug |
| `dlopen("libfoo.so.42")` | Dynamic plugin loading; check plugin path |

---

## [3] Static analysis with Ghidra

When triage + tracing have narrowed you to "something in function X" or "the crypto routine is weird", open Ghidra.

**Open [tools/ghidra.md](../tools/ghidra.md) before launching Ghidra** — the import / analyze / decompile workflow is not obvious and first-time users waste an hour figuring it out.

Ghidra's decompiler turns machine code into readable-ish C. That's usually what you want. Stay in the Decompiler view; drop to Listing (disassembly) only when the decompiler punts.

---

## [4] Dynamic debugging with pwndbg

Once static analysis gives you a hypothesis ("this branch at 0x401234 is where the validation fails"), confirm it at runtime with pwndbg.

**Open [tools/pwndbg.md](../tools/pwndbg.md) before launching gdb.** Pwndbg gives you the context view (registers / stack / disasm / code all visible at once) which is essential for binary debugging.

Typical pwndbg flow:

```
$ gdb ./target                                 # pwndbg loads automatically if installed
pwndbg> break *0x401234                        # break at the address static analysis flagged
pwndbg> run arg1 arg2
# At the breakpoint:
pwndbg> context                                # registers + stack + disasm
pwndbg> telescope $rdi                         # walk pointers at $rdi
pwndbg> x/20xw $rsp                            # raw dump of stack
pwndbg> ni / si                                # step next / step instruction
```

---

## [5] Scripted reproduction with pwntools

Once you have a hypothesis with a concrete repro input, lock it down with pwntools. This is the "failing test" equivalent for binaries.

**Open [tools/pwntools.md](../tools/pwntools.md)** — the Process/Remote/ELF/context APIs are the foundation.

```python
from pwn import *

context.binary = elf = ELF('./target')

p = process('./target')
p.sendlineafter(b'> ', b'<trigger input that reproduces the bug>')
result = p.recvall(timeout=3)
assert b'expected-output-when-fixed' in result, f'bug repro: {result}'
```

This script is now your "red test". When the fix is applied, the script should pass (or the assertion should be inverted for negative tests — e.g. "the crash string should NOT appear").

---

## [6] Fixing a binary bug you can't recompile

Three options, in preference order:

### Option A: Patch at the source (if you have it)

If the bug is in your own code and source is available, fix it there and rebuild. Standard TDD path.

### Option B: Binary patch

For tiny fixes (one byte, one branch inversion):

```bash
# Identify the exact byte offset
# e.g. Ghidra says the bug is at 0x401234 = file offset 0x1234
printf '\x90\x90' | dd of=./target bs=1 seek=$((0x1234)) conv=notrunc
```

Journal the exact `dd` command and the original bytes so you can revert.

### Option C: Wrap / shim

If you can't patch the binary, write a shim library (LD_PRELOAD on Linux, DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES on macOS) that overrides the buggy function. pwntools has examples.

### Option D: Report upstream

If it's a third-party binary and none of the above are feasible, the "fix" is a high-quality bug report with:
- Full triage summary
- Reproducible pwntools script
- Ghidra decompilation of the buggy function
- Hypothesis about the root cause
- Recommended patch sketch (in C or pseudocode)

---

## Silent-failure patterns in native binaries

| Pattern | Why it's silent |
|---|---|
| Ignored libc return codes (`read`, `write`, `malloc`) | Bug continues with garbage data; no check |
| Signal handler swallows SIGSEGV | Crash converted to "something didn't work"; no log |
| `setjmp`/`longjmp` unwinding over cleanup | Resources leak silently |
| Thread-local error state never read (`errno`, `GetLastError`) | Error happened, nobody asked |
| Recovered assertion failure in release build | `assert` compiled out; precondition violations silently corrupt |
| Dangling pointer reads after free | Often looks like valid data until it doesn't |

---

## Phase 9 cleanup specifics

```bash
# Kill debugger sessions
pkill -f 'gdb' || true
pkill -f 'lldb' || true

# Ghidra scratch projects (if made just for this session)
# Named something like ~/ghidra-projects/debug-<timestamp>:
ls -la ~/ghidra-projects/ 2>/dev/null
# rm -rf ~/ghidra-projects/debug-scratch         # only if the journal says to

# Core dumps left from crashes
rm -f ./core ./core.* ~/core.*

# strace/ltrace output files
rm -f trace.out ltrace.out

# If you made a binary patch (Option B above), confirm revert
# The journal should have the original bytes — restore them:
# printf '<original-bytes>' | dd of=./target bs=1 seek=<offset> conv=notrunc

# Trace-output files
rm -f /tmp/debug-*.bin /tmp/debug-*.strace /tmp/debug-*.ltrace

# macOS-specific:
# Restore proxy settings if you set them (CRITICAL — leaves system traffic mis-routed otherwise)
# Use the SAME $SERVICE you used when enabling the proxy (read it from the journal).
# Do NOT hardcode "Wi-Fi" — many machines route traffic over Ethernet, USB tether, or a VPN service.
[ -n "$SERVICE" ] && {
  networksetup -setwebproxystate "$SERVICE" off 2>/dev/null
  networksetup -setsecurewebproxystate "$SERVICE" off 2>/dev/null
}
# Or restore explicitly from the journaled original state — see the proxy section above.

# Stop mitmproxy
pkill -f 'mitmproxy' 2>/dev/null

# Remove DYLD shim libraries you built
rm -f /tmp/*-shim.dylib

# Clear extracted strings dumps (these can be huge and may contain secrets)
rm -f /tmp/*-strings*.txt

# Verify hostname resolution returns to normal (mitmproxy can leave entries)
scutil --dns | head -20
```
