description: "Layer A interaction-mechanics reference anchored to the beui.dev catalog. Stacks on any style skill whenever work adds or changes motion or interaction — micro-interactions, animated components, transitions, gestures, hover/press/state feedback, loading/success/error morphs, 'make it feel alive'. Mandates reading the mapped beui.dev component source before designing an interaction; owns interaction mechanics and reduced-motion discipline; owns zero visual taste. Load it alongside a style skill; it does not replace one."

# Interaction Mechanics — beui.dev-Anchored

Style skills decide how a surface looks. This file decides how it *moves and responds* — spring physics, layout morphs, enter/exit orchestration, gesture feel, and reduced-motion discipline. It stacks on top of any Layer A style skill and any Layer B brand, exactly like `layout-skill.md`, and adds ZERO visual direction: color, type, and material still come from the style skill and `DESIGN.md`.

Load this whenever the deliverable includes interaction feel: micro-interactions, animated components, transitions, hover/press/focus/state feedback, gestures, loading/success/error morphs, animated tabs/menus/modals/drawers/toasts — or the user says "make it feel alive", "polish the interactions", "add micro-interactions".

## 1. The reference contract — never design an interaction from memory

[beui.dev](https://beui.dev) is the interaction benchmark: free, open-source animated React components (Motion + Tailwind CSS) where every component ships reduced-motion support and the full TypeScript source is one `curl` away. Improvised interaction design produces slop motion the same way freestyled styling produces generic SaaS slop, and the fix is the same: consult the reference before designing.

The contract, in order:

1. **Find the nearest pattern** in the catalog (section 3). The live catalog is `https://beui.dev/llms.txt`; refresh from it when a pattern seems missing from the tables below.
2. **Read its real source** through the recipe (section 2). Never guess spring values, exit orchestration, or gesture thresholds from a preview description.
3. **Extract the mechanism**, not the pixels: the spring config, the layout strategy (`layoutId` shared layout vs height morph vs clip-path), what animates in what order on enter/exit, where blur crossfades sit, and what the reduced-motion path swaps to.
4. **Adapt to the project.** Concrete durations, easings, and spring params come from the project `DESIGN.md` Motion & Interaction section. Where beui.dev and `DESIGN.md` disagree, `DESIGN.md` wins. A value that is not in `DESIGN.md` gets added there first, then used.
5. **No matching pattern?** Compose from the nearest two, or state explicitly that the interaction is novel and record its mechanism in `DESIGN.md` before building it.

## 2. Consultation recipe (curl-only, verified 2026-07)

All endpoints are public, no auth, no browser:

```bash
curl -s https://beui.dev/llms.txt                          # full catalog: every component + one-line feel
curl -s https://beui.dev/r                                 # registry index (JSON): slugs, categories, endpoints
curl -s https://beui.dev/r/{slug}                          # component detail (JSON): files, dependencies, dates
curl -s https://beui.dev/r/{slug}/raw                      # component source (TypeScript) — the thing to read
curl -s https://beui.dev/components/{category}/{slug}.md   # component doc page as markdown
```

Categories are `motion` (primitives) and `blocks` (composed patterns). When the user wants the component itself rather than the mechanism, a shadcn-style item registry exists at `https://beui.dev/r/{slug}.json`. Read source to learn; do not vendor beui.dev files into reference docs, and do not paste whole components into a project when only the mechanism is needed.

This table is the edge of this catalog. Hero atmospheres, animated or shader backgrounds, typographic reveals, scroll chapters, and card surface effects route to `ambience-skill.md`, whose react-bits map and retrofit checklist own that quadrant.

## 4. Mechanics rules

These sharpen the shared axioms for interaction work; none of them replace the style skill.

- **Motion serves meaning, and each meaning has its motion.** Every animation maps to a real interaction, state change, or affordance; a hover that changes nothing is slop. Pick the motion from the meaning, not from the catalog's most striking demo:

  | Meaning | Motion | Not |
  |---|---|---|
  | Press acknowledged | Scale or wash on the element, same frame | A ripple that arrives after the action fires |
  | Something is in progress | A moving indicator | A static one, which reads as frozen |
  | Something is live or new | A brief highlight or subtle pulse, once | A permanent loop |
  | Something arrived from elsewhere | Enter from the direction of its origin | A fade-in from nowhere |
  | Something moved | It travels there | Disappear here, appear there |
  | An unfamiliar control exists | A one-time introduction on first appearance | Continuous decoration |

- **Transitions keep identity.** A surface that resizes, repositions, or swaps content animates from its old geometry to the new one (`layoutId` shared layout or a measured-height morph); the user must never suspect a replacement. When items move and others appear, move first, then add. Keep one element still as the anchor while the rest animates. Nothing reflows under the pointer while the user is typing or dragging. A panel leaves the way it came: a sheet that rose from the bottom dismisses downward, and the reverse gesture undoes the forward one.
- **Reduced motion is part of the component, not an afterthought.** Every beui.dev component ships a reduced-motion path; match that bar, and reduce rather than remove: under `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`, positional, scale, and depth motion becomes a cross-fade (the `loader` pattern's opacity-pulse swap is the model); fades, gesture-tracked motion, and progress indicators stay; blur never animates its start or end. Any state that motion conveys is also announced (`aria-live`, a label change). React Native: respect the system reduce-motion setting.
- **GPU-composited properties only** — `transform`, `opacity`, `filter`. Never animate layout properties; morph layout through shared-layout (`layoutId`) or measured height primitives instead.
- **Springs move things; easings tint things; continuous input tracks.** Spatial movement (position, scale, layout morphs) wants spring physics so it stays interruptible and retargetable. Color, opacity, and blur want short duration + easing. Discrete input (a tap, a keypress) animates; continuous input (a drag, a wheel, a slider) follows the pointer 1:1 with no interpolation, then settles with a spring on release. Do not put a fixed-duration tween on a gesture-driven surface.
- **Interruptibility is non-negotiable.** A press, hover-out, or route change mid-animation must retarget smoothly, never queue or block input, and never snap to the end state. This is the practical reason beui.dev uses springs — copy that property, not just the bounce.
- **One event, one feedback.** Feedback lives on the object that changed. Do not stack a spinner over a control that already shows progress, re-animate a native control, or confirm routine success with a toast: success is assumed and shown by the changed state; failure is always reported, next to the object, with the cause. Prefer undo to a confirmation dialog; a dialog is for uncommon and irreversible loss only, its buttons name the outcome ("Delete", "Keep editing"), and neither Cancel nor the destructive action takes the default (Enter) role. Send the request when the input lands, not when the acknowledging animation ends.
- **Motion never regresses input latency or stream rendering.** Measure with the `perfection` ruleset when in doubt; a virtualized list's measurement contract beats a pretty reveal.
- **Library choice is a project decision, not a default.** beui.dev assumes Motion (motion.dev) + Tailwind. If the project already has a motion stack, adapt the mechanism to it. If it has none: CSS transitions/WAAPI cover micro-interactions; adding a library is justified by shared-layout or spring-physics needs and gets recorded (with bundle cost) in `DESIGN.md`. Check `package.json` before importing anything.

## 5. DESIGN.md integration

`design-system-architecture.md` defines a Motion & Interaction section in every `DESIGN.md`. This file feeds it:

- Extracted spring configs, durations, and easings land there as named tokens before components use them.
- Each shipped interaction traces to a catalog pattern (or a recorded novel mechanism) plus its reduced-motion behavior.
- New reusable interaction patterns (used 2+ times) get documented back into `DESIGN.md` Section 5 with their states, like any other primitive.

## 6. Verification

Interaction work is verified through `/visual-qa` with motion actually driven and inspected — hover, press, open/close, swipe, and theme transitions exercised on the rendered surface, an interruption pass (retarget mid-animation, dismiss mid-open) proving nothing snaps or blocks, and a reduced-motion pass (emulate `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`) proving the fallback exists. Timing-sensitive changes record a short screen capture, not just stills.
