# ATTRIBUTION / NOTICE

This package (`@oh-my-opencode/shared-skills`) includes third-party content that is
redistributed under its original license, consistent with the project's distribution
license (see `LICENSE.md`: "All third party components incorporated into the
oh-my-opencode Software are licensed under the original license provided by the owner of
the applicable component"). Each upstream's license and required notices are reproduced
below. Modifications to the original files are noted where applicable.

These third-party references are NOT committed to this repository. Each upstream is
tracked as a pinned git submodule under `packages/shared-skills/upstreams/<name>`, and the
build materializes the referenced files path-mapped into this skill's `references/` tree,
when packaging the published artifact. The file bodies are copied verbatim, except
materialized `SKILL.md` frontmatter may normalize an unquoted single-line `description:`
scalar into a JSON-quoted YAML string so Codex/OpenCode frontmatter parsing remains
deterministic; the description text itself is unchanged. The `Pinned upstream commit` line
in each section below records the exact submodule commit that the materialization reads.

## 1. Open Design (brand design-system DESIGN.md references)

The brand design-system reference files under `frontend/references/design/<brand>.md`
(Apple, Stripe, Linear, Nike, BMW, Airbnb, Bugatti, Tesla, and the other named brands)
are path-mapped verbatim copies of the `design-systems/<brand>/DESIGN.md` files from the
Open Design project. They are not committed here; the build materializes them from the
pinned submodule under `packages/shared-skills/upstreams/open-design` into
`frontend/references/design/<brand>.md` (dots in `<brand>` map to dashes for the upstream
directory name, e.g. `linear.app` -> `linear-app`).

- **Changes (Apache-2.0 §4(b)):** the original `DESIGN.md` design-system files are
  redistributed verbatim. The only modification is path-mapping: each upstream
  `design-systems/<brand>/DESIGN.md` is renamed to `frontend/references/design/<brand>.md`
  (with dots in the brand name mapped to dashes for the upstream directory lookup). The
  file contents are byte-for-byte identical to the pinned upstream commit; no text is
  abridged, summarized, or rewritten.

- **Trademark notice:** All product names, brand names, trademarks, and registered
  trademarks referenced in these design-system files (e.g. Apple, BMW, Airbnb, Bugatti,
  Stripe, Nike, Tesla, and other named brands) are the property of their respective owners
  and are used for identification and descriptive purposes only. This project is not
  affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by any of those brands. No trademark license

  name only; no font binaries are included.

## 2. taste-skill (Leonxlnx) — taste and image-generation skills

The taste-skill files and image-generation skills under `frontend/references/design/`
(`taste-skill.md`, `gpt-tasteskill.md`, `minimalist-skill.md`, `brutalist-skill.md`,
`soft-skill.md`, `redesign-skill.md`, `image-to-code-skill.md`, `output-skill.md`,
`stitch-skill.md`, `imagegen-frontend-web.md`, `imagegen-frontend-mobile.md`,
`imagegen-brandkit.md`) are path-mapped copies of the per-skill `SKILL.md` files from the
taste-skill project (each `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` is renamed to
`references/design/<name>.md`; `imagegen-brandkit.md` maps from `skills/brandkit/SKILL.md`).
`stitch-design-example.md` is a path-mapped verbatim copy of `skills/stitch-skill/DESIGN.md`,
the worked example of the design-system document that the stitch skill exports.
They are not committed here; the build materializes them from the pinned submodule under
`packages/shared-skills/upstreams/taste-skill`. Only the allowed frontmatter description
quoting normalization described above may alter these materialized `SKILL.md` files.

## 3. UI/UX Pro Max — Design Intelligence Skill (Next Level Builder) — ui-ux-db

The search engine and dataset under `frontend/references/ui-ux-db/` (`scripts/core.py`,
`scripts/search.py`, `scripts/design_system.py`, `README.md`, and the `data/*.csv`
knowledge base) are path-mapped verbatim copies from the UI/UX Pro Max skill. They are not
committed here; the build materializes them from the pinned submodule under
`packages/shared-skills/upstreams/ui-ux-pro-max`:
`scripts/*.py` from `src/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/`, `data/*.csv` from
`src/ui-ux-pro-max/data/` (`data/web-interface.csv` maps from the upstream
`data/app-interface.csv`), and `README.md` from `.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/SKILL.md`.

- Source: https://github.com/nextlevelbuilder/ui-ux-pro-max-skill
- Pinned upstream commit: f32d6a61cdf0bfd57404c45854583fd19ff95088
- "UI/UX Pro Max" is the upstream project's branding; no trademark rights are granted by
  the MIT license, and this distribution does not claim that name as its own.

## 4. designpowers (Owl-Listener) — design operating-layer references

The designpowers reference corpus under `frontend/references/designpowers/vendor/` is
path-mapped from the designpowers project. It is not committed here; the build
materializes the selected files from the pinned submodule under
`packages/shared-skills/upstreams/designpowers`. The materialized set includes the
upstream `LICENSE`, ten `agents/*.md` role-reference files, and selected
`skills/*/SKILL.md` files renamed to `vendor/skills/*/reference.md` so they remain
reference documents instead of nested skill entrypoints. Bridge/state/router integration skills are intentionally
excluded; see `frontend/references/designpowers/UPSTREAM.md` for the allowlist and
exclusion list. Only the allowed frontmatter description quoting normalization described
above may alter these materialized `reference.md` files.

- Source: https://github.com/Owl-Listener/designpowers
- Pinned upstream commit: cb00757da9d554591fa78d27aa1854d60a05c4f7

## 5. Project-original files

`frontend/SKILL.md`, `frontend/references/design/README.md`, `_INDEX.md`, `aside.md`,
`design-system-architecture.md`, `react-dev-tooling-skill.md`,
`frontend/references/perfection/README.md`, `react-perf-tooling.md`, and
`frontend/scripts/perfection/lighthouse-audit.py` are original to this project and require
no third-party attribution. The perfection docs and script only invoke third-party tools
(react-scan, react-doctor, react-grab, playwright-lighthouse, lighthouse, chrome-launcher)
at runtime; no source from those tools is vendored, so their licenses are not carried here.

`frontend/references/design/aside.md` is a project-original synthesis from live browser
capture evidence and a local reconnaissance run following the MIT-licensed
`JCodesMore/ai-website-cloner-template` workflow; it is not copied from Aside or from the
template. Aside names, trademarks, product text, and visual assets remain the property of
their respective owners and are referenced only for descriptive design-analysis purposes.

`frontend/references/design/lazyweb.md` is a project-original, curl-only operating guide
for the Lazyweb (lazyweb.com) design-research API, written from live endpoint verification;
no Lazyweb source, documentation text, or screenshot content is vendored. Lazyweb names
remain the property of their owner, and the guide grants no license to ship, trace, or
commit reference screenshots harvested through it.

`frontend/references/design/interaction-skill.md` is a project-original, curl-only
operating guide for consulting the beui.dev animated-component registry during interaction
and motion work, written from live endpoint verification; no beui.dev source code,
documentation text, or component implementations are vendored. beui.dev names remain the
property of their owner, and the guide instructs reading component source for mechanism
extraction only, not vendoring it into references or projects.

`frontend/references/design/ambience-skill.md` is a project-original, curl-only operating
guide for consulting the react-bits (reactbits.dev) animated-component registry during hero
atmosphere, background, typographic-motion, and card-surface work, written from live endpoint
verification; no react-bits source code, documentation text, or component implementations are
vendored. react-bits is distributed under MIT plus the Commons Clause, which permits use inside
applications but forbids redistributing or porting the components themselves; the guide
therefore instructs reading component source for mechanism extraction only and never vendoring
it into references, design documents, or this repository. React Bits names remain the property
of their owner.

`frontend/references/design/clone-from-url.md` is a project-original runtime-extraction
workflow guide. Its browser + `getComputedStyle` clone approach follows the same
MIT-licensed `JCodesMore/ai-website-cloner-template` clone-website workflow that `aside.md`
cites; no source from that template is copied. It carries no third-party attribution beyond
that lineage note, and it grants no license to copy any target site's trademarks, brand
assets, or proprietary copy.
