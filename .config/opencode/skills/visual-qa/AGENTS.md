# visual-qa — Bundled Visual-Evidence CLI

**Generated:** 2026-08-24 (f3642fcda)

## OVERVIEW

The visual-QA skill's executable core: a zero-dependency Node CLI that produces machine evidence (`image-diff`, `tui-check`) plus the TypeScript sources it is bundled from. Earned this file: the only shared skill shipping a built bundle whose runtime and development sources must be kept in lockstep.

## BUNDLE/SOURCE DUALITY

`visual-qa.mjs` is the artifact the skill's commands invoke (`node "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/visual-qa.mjs" …`); the `.ts` files exist for development and tests only. A behavior fix lands in the TS source AND the bundle is regenerated from `cli.ts` — editing one without the other makes tests and runtime disagree. Never hand-edit the `.mjs`.

## SURFACE

- Commands: `image-diff <reference.png> <actual.png>` and `tui-check <capture.txt> --cols <N>`; JSON verdict output (hotspot cells, overflow lines, wide-char columns, border alignment).
- Module exports: `diffImages`, `checkTui`, `charWidth`/`stringWidth`, ANSI + PNG helpers. `cli.ts` owns `CliError`, `parseColumns`, `run`, `main`.

## CONVENTIONS

- Zero runtime dependencies — PNG decode/synthesis and ANSI handling are hand-rolled in `scripts/`; keep it that way (the bundle must stay require-free apart from `node:` builtins).
- Width is never `String.length`: CJK wide characters and ANSI escapes are accounted for before any column math.
- Tests are co-located `bun test scripts/*.test.ts`, given/when/then style per repo convention.

## ANTI-PATTERNS

- NEVER hand-edit `visual-qa.mjs`; regenerate from source.
- Don't add an npm dependency to make PNG/diff easier — the no-dep bundle is the point.
- Column math that ignores CJK width or ANSI escapes is wrong by construction; `tui-check` exists because text-diff tools get terminal grids wrong.
- Skill-level rule worth repeating for code changes: `tmux capture-pane` is forbidden as a capture mechanism.

## COMMANDS

```bash
# from packages/shared-skills/skills/visual-qa/
node scripts/visual-qa.mjs image-diff <reference.png> <actual.png>
node scripts/visual-qa.mjs tui-check <capture.txt> --cols 80
bun test scripts/*.test.ts
```
